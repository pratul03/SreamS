00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:23,691
<i>A long time ago,</i>

4
00:00:25,568 --> 00:00:30,197
<i>there lived a beautiful girl in a castle
located deep inside the forest.</i>

5
00:00:34,910 --> 00:00:37,079
<i>She was always alone,
so she was lonely and bored.</i>

6
00:00:38,330 --> 00:00:42,167
<i>So one day, she left the castle
to find herself a friend to play with.</i>

7
00:00:45,546 --> 00:00:48,799
<i>She offered them
all sorts of amazing gifts,</i>

8
00:00:49,425 --> 00:00:51,093
<i>but nobody ever accepted her.</i>

9
00:00:52,928 --> 00:00:55,723
<i>Later on, she found out why.</i>

10
00:00:57,182 --> 00:00:59,310
<i>A monster who brings along
the shadow of death.</i>

11
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:01,645
<i>That's what the people called her.</i>

12
00:01:02,980 --> 00:01:05,149
<i>"She's a monster. A monster."</i>

13
00:01:09,486 --> 00:01:12,072
<i>She was very angry
at every living soul in the world.</i>

14
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,950
<i>And she needed to take it out on someone.</i>

15
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:52,863
<i>Ever since she had unexpectedly
saved the boy from dying,</i>

16
00:01:54,031 --> 00:01:58,452
<i>the scary shadow that always
followed her around suddenly disappeared.</i>

17
00:02:01,664 --> 00:02:05,084
<i>And the boy always
followed her around instead.</i>

18
00:02:06,502 --> 00:02:09,588
<i>He always went with her
whether it was day or night</i>

19
00:02:10,547 --> 00:02:12,591
<i>and whether she was in the mountains
or on a field.</i>

20
00:02:15,761 --> 00:02:18,639
<i>On a clear and sunny day,
the girl asked him this.</i>

21
00:02:19,348 --> 00:02:23,102
<i>"Hey, will you always stay by my side?"</i>

22
00:02:24,061 --> 00:02:26,647
<i>"Of course. I will never run away."</i>

23
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:30,067
<i>"Even after you see this?"</i>

24
00:02:45,833 --> 00:02:47,751
<i>The girl was all alone again,</i>

25
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:50,963
<i>and that's when the shadow of death
came back and whispered this.</i>

26
00:02:53,924 --> 00:02:56,427
<i>"No one can ever stay by your side</i>

27
00:02:57,761 --> 00:03:01,306
<i>because you're a monster.</i>

28
00:03:02,599 --> 00:03:06,520
<i>Do not ever forget that.
Do you understand?"</i>

29
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:10,190
Yes, Mother.

32
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:32,713
<i>This stop is Daun Vocational School.</i>

33
00:03:33,297 --> 00:03:35,758
<i>The next stop is...</i>

34
00:03:43,849 --> 00:03:47,311
<i>I mean, he threw a huge fit
in the middle of class.</i>

35
00:03:47,394 --> 00:03:48,729
<i>My goodness.</i>

36
00:03:49,146 --> 00:03:50,439
No!

37
00:03:57,279 --> 00:03:58,947
There's no use in trying to stop him.

38
00:03:59,031 --> 00:04:01,158
And this isn't the first time.

39
00:04:01,241 --> 00:04:02,659
<i>Your expression shows your emotions</i>

40
00:04:02,743 --> 00:04:04,995
What if there was a dangerous tool
right next to him?

41
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:06,747
It would've led to an accident.

42
00:04:16,632 --> 00:04:19,426
I don't understand
why we always need to walk on eggshells

43
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:21,386
-because of Sang-tae.
-Is he angry?

44
00:04:21,470 --> 00:04:22,721
Is he angry?

45
00:04:24,306 --> 00:04:26,183
-Anyway, we need to think of safety,
-Angry...

46
00:04:26,266 --> 00:04:28,310
-Getting annoyed.
-and he's too much for us to handle.

47
00:04:28,393 --> 00:04:32,689
Just send him to a special needs school
or a local community center.

48
00:04:32,773 --> 00:04:34,900
That will be best for everyone.

49
00:04:34,983 --> 00:04:38,237
-<i>Your expression shows your emotions</i>
-Tell me what you think.

50
00:04:38,654 --> 00:04:39,613
What do you think?

51
00:04:40,197 --> 00:04:42,658
Will you please say something?
My gosh, seriously.

52
00:04:58,799 --> 00:05:00,217
He's angry.

Sang-tae.

56
00:05:46,555 --> 00:05:47,806
Aren't you hungry?

57
00:05:53,979 --> 00:05:55,355
What do you want to eat?

58
00:05:59,318 --> 00:06:01,403
You weren't planning to stay here
for that long anyway.

59
00:06:04,531 --> 00:06:06,867
I'll find you a better school
once we move.

60
00:06:06,950 --> 00:06:07,993
I promise.

61
00:06:13,707 --> 00:06:15,375

-<i>Jjamppong.</i>

62
00:06:15,542 --> 00:06:17,502
-What?
-<i>Tangsuyuk</i> with sauce on the side.

63
00:06:17,586 --> 00:06:20,756
Let's not go to Jageumseong.
Let's eat at Yangjagang.

64
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:25,135
Okay, let's stuff ourselves with food
at Yangjagang.

65
00:06:25,218 --> 00:06:27,095
The food is really good there.
Do you remember?

66
00:06:28,930 --> 00:06:31,016
When was the last time we went?

67
00:06:31,099 --> 00:06:33,226
Don't worry. I'll buy.
I'm your big brother.

68
00:07:37,499 --> 00:07:40,127
By any chance, are you
Author Ko Mun-yeong?

69
00:07:41,503 --> 00:07:43,463
-Yes.
-See? I told you.

70
00:07:44,506 --> 00:07:47,217
My daughter is a big fan of yours.

71
00:07:47,634 --> 00:07:49,052
I'm sorry to ask this,

72
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,806
but can we please get your autograph?

73
00:08:00,439 --> 00:08:02,858
-Your name?
-Lee Seul-bi.

74
00:08:03,900 --> 00:08:06,486
She's really beautiful in real life,
isn't she?

75
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:10,282
Yes, she's like a princess
from a fairy tale.

76
00:08:18,081 --> 00:08:20,751
-Why do you think I'm like a princess?
-Because you're pretty.

77
00:08:21,334 --> 00:08:24,713
My mom always calls me "princess"

78
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,089
because I'm pretty.

79
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:32,888
Ma'am, how about a photo?

80
00:08:32,971 --> 00:08:34,556
My goodness, thank you.

81
00:08:34,639 --> 00:08:36,183
Go stand next to her.

82
00:08:37,976 --> 00:08:38,935
Come here.

83
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:46,610
You're not my fan, are you?

84
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:49,362
Pardon?

85
00:08:49,863 --> 00:08:53,408
In all my fairy tales,
the witch is always the one that's pretty.

86
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,080
Who told you all princesses
are kind and pretty?

87
00:08:58,872 --> 00:09:00,248
Did your mom tell you that?

88
00:09:00,332 --> 00:09:02,876
Princess, look over here.

89
00:09:03,502 --> 00:09:06,671
If you really want to be that pretty,
I want you to say this.

90
00:09:07,172 --> 00:09:09,466
-One.
-"Mom.

91
00:09:10,509 --> 00:09:12,552
-I'm going to be...
-Two.

92
00:09:13,303 --> 00:09:16,306
a pretty witch."

93
00:09:16,890 --> 00:09:17,724
Three.

94
00:09:24,439 --> 00:09:25,440
Princess.

95
00:09:25,524 --> 00:09:28,443
-Oh, goodness.
-Princess!

96
00:09:30,529 --> 00:09:31,988
My gosh.

97
00:09:35,367 --> 00:09:36,618
My gosh. Mun-yeong.

98
00:09:40,622 --> 00:09:42,249
<i>Buongiorno</i>, Mun-yeong.

99
00:09:43,124 --> 00:09:45,961
My gosh, what's with this chain?

100
00:09:48,547 --> 00:09:51,258
What made that little kid cry her eyes out
so early in the morning?

101
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:54,219
I guess she was touched.
I helped her correct her misconception.

102
00:09:55,303 --> 00:09:56,138
What in the world...

103
00:09:59,099 --> 00:10:00,225
Good job.

104
00:10:00,725 --> 00:10:04,354
It can be very dangerous
for a kid to be biased towards something.

105
00:10:04,437 --> 00:10:06,064
But you helped her fix that?

106
00:10:06,773 --> 00:10:09,693
You really are amazing, Mun-yeong.

107
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:11,403
Just a second.

108
00:10:14,364 --> 00:10:15,282
<font color="#ffff80">OK PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITAL</font>

109
00:10:15,365 --> 00:10:17,492
I don't need your loan. I'm already rich.

110
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:22,789
Okay, let's get going.

111
00:10:22,873 --> 00:10:24,583
We have about two hours.

112
00:10:24,666 --> 00:10:26,585
So you have time to go to a beauty salon.

113
00:10:26,877 --> 00:10:27,711
Why would I go there?

114
00:10:29,796 --> 00:10:31,464
You can't go there looking like that.

115
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,385
You look like Francesca
who is on her way to a funeral

116
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:37,804
for the Addams Family.

117
00:10:37,888 --> 00:10:40,265
You can't go to a children's ward
looking like that.

118
00:10:40,765 --> 00:10:44,394
You're not going there to scare the kids.
You're going there to give them hope.

119
00:10:44,477 --> 00:10:46,146
You'll be reading your fairy tale there.

120
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,982
-But you look--
-You said it's dangerous to be biased.

121
00:10:49,566 --> 00:10:51,484
I personally think you're more dangerous.

122
00:10:52,611 --> 00:10:55,071
Mun-yeong, please.

123
00:10:55,155 --> 00:10:57,032
You should dress according to the TPO.

124
00:11:03,955 --> 00:11:06,207
I'll tell them to come to you.

125
00:11:08,793 --> 00:11:11,046
Do you know why I like this restaurant?

126
00:11:12,005 --> 00:11:15,008
-Because the steak--
-No.

127
00:11:17,260 --> 00:11:18,386
The knife here

128
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,014
is amazing.

129
00:11:23,558 --> 00:11:25,518
-Look.
-Mun-yeong, you're bleeding.

130
00:11:27,479 --> 00:11:28,730
How pretty.

131
00:11:30,815 --> 00:11:31,858
I want it.

132
00:11:36,071 --> 00:11:37,989
Good gracious.

133
00:11:40,408 --> 00:11:41,451
Ma'am.

134
00:11:43,620 --> 00:11:44,496
Just a second.

135
00:12:17,112 --> 00:12:18,530
<font color="#ffff80">EMPLOYEE CARD CAREGIVER MOON GANG-TAE</font>

136
00:12:20,323 --> 00:12:22,075
Mr. Moon, you need to come to the lounge.

137
00:12:27,706 --> 00:12:31,626
Gosh, that thief ate all my food.

138
00:12:32,210 --> 00:12:33,753
It's as if she's been starving for days.

139
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:44,264
Ms. Myoung Ji-suk.

140
00:12:47,892 --> 00:12:48,727
Honey.

141
00:12:57,402 --> 00:12:58,862
I feel so empty.

142
00:12:59,863 --> 00:13:02,365
Even so,
you shouldn't eat in such a hurry.

143
00:13:02,907 --> 00:13:04,617
If you do,
you'll get an upset stomach again.

144
00:13:05,410 --> 00:13:07,746
So don't eat everything all at once.

145
00:13:09,247 --> 00:13:11,458
Instead, it'd be great
if you could take your time

146
00:13:12,792 --> 00:13:14,586
to eat your food.

147
00:13:15,170 --> 00:13:16,921
You told me you liked that I ate well.

148
00:13:18,590 --> 00:13:20,633
You took it the wrong way.

149
00:13:20,717 --> 00:13:24,262
It's just that when you like someone,
you even like the way they eat.

150
00:13:28,433 --> 00:13:29,601
Honey.

151
00:13:32,729 --> 00:13:33,772
Then

152
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:40,236
why did you cheat on me
with that skinny model?

153
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:35,792
It's okay.

154
00:14:37,877 --> 00:14:39,170
Don't smile at me.

155
00:14:40,338 --> 00:14:41,506
It disgusts me.

156
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:48,471
-Put your arms up like this.
-Let me go!

157
00:14:48,555 --> 00:14:50,682
Then pull them down like this.

158
00:14:51,182 --> 00:14:52,767
-Stay still!
-I don't belong here!

159
00:14:52,851 --> 00:14:55,520
Let me go! Let go of me!

160
00:14:55,603 --> 00:14:57,564
I can't go in here! I can't!

161
00:14:57,814 --> 00:14:59,190
Let go!

162
00:14:59,399 --> 00:15:01,025
I don't belong here!

163
00:15:01,317 --> 00:15:02,735
-Is he a new patient?
-Let me go!

164
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:05,155
Two days ago, he overdosed
on alprazolam with his daughter

165
00:15:05,238 --> 00:15:06,531
and came as an emergency patient.

166
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:09,242
He used to get treated
for his anxiety disorder.

167
00:15:09,325 --> 00:15:11,327
I think he tried
to commit suicide with her.

168
00:15:11,536 --> 00:15:14,956
By the looks of it, I think he wanted to
kill his daughter and then kill himself.

169
00:15:15,039 --> 00:15:16,040
Where's Go-eun?

170
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,544
Where is Go-eun? Where is my daughter?

171
00:15:19,627 --> 00:15:22,213
<i>Fortunately, she threw up
right after she took the drug.</i>

172
00:15:22,297 --> 00:15:25,967
<i>And she's getting counseling for PTSD
at our child psychology department.</i>

173
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:27,594
Go-eun.

174
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:30,180
Go-eun, what's on your mind?

175
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:33,266
<i>Let me go!</i>

176
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:36,019
He's going to receive
a psychiatric assessment this afternoon.

177
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:37,645
So check his vitals every hour.

178
00:15:37,729 --> 00:15:40,940
And double-check the restraining band
as you give him an IV fluid.

179
00:15:41,524 --> 00:15:42,442
Okay.

180
00:15:43,193 --> 00:15:45,403
After the reading, you will
answer questions from the audience.

181
00:15:45,486 --> 00:15:48,865
Then you'll give out
your autographed storybooks to the kids.

182
00:15:48,948 --> 00:15:52,577
And you'll be done once you take a photo
with the hospital staff for PR.

183
00:15:56,039 --> 00:15:59,542
I'm not sure if I'm a secretary
or the CEO of a publishing company.

184
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,502
I'm seriously starting to wonder.

185
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:04,672
I got hired as an art director.

186
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:08,801
But I had no idea that I'd be
working as your minion.

187
00:16:08,885 --> 00:16:11,137
Hey, you told me you'll do anything
during the interview.

188
00:16:11,221 --> 00:16:15,642
Well, I didn't know
you'd make me do physical labor.

189
00:16:15,725 --> 00:16:18,186
I hired you
knowing that you're not very smart.

190
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:20,813
What do you want me to do?
Should I just fire you?

191
00:16:20,980 --> 00:16:21,814
No.

193
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:29,405
“OK Psychiatric Hospital”?

194
00:16:30,490 --> 00:16:31,991
Sir, do you get counseling?

195
00:16:32,617 --> 00:16:34,536
That's such a good idea.

196
00:16:36,538 --> 00:16:37,997
Answer the phone.

197
00:16:43,044 --> 00:16:45,171
-Hello?
-Put it on speaker.

198
00:16:48,091 --> 00:16:50,677
<i>Hello? Mr. Lee?</i>

199
00:16:51,719 --> 00:16:54,389
<i>I'm Nam Ju-ri,
a nurse at OK Psychiatric Hospital.</i>

200
00:16:54,764 --> 00:16:55,974
Come this way.

201
00:16:56,474 --> 00:16:59,644
It's so hard to reach you.
You never text us back either.

202
00:17:01,479 --> 00:17:02,814
Are you listening?

203
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,317
Oh, yes. I'm a bit busy--

204
00:17:06,401 --> 00:17:07,652
<i>I believe we told you</i>

205
00:17:08,236 --> 00:17:10,446
that we set a date
for Mr. Ko Dae-hwan's surgery.

206
00:17:13,574 --> 00:17:15,410
How long do we need to wait

207
00:17:16,661 --> 00:17:18,121
for the guardian's consent?

208
00:17:19,122 --> 00:17:21,624
You can't keep
avoiding our calls like this.

209
00:17:23,084 --> 00:17:25,086
That's the same thing
as killing the patient.

210
00:17:25,962 --> 00:17:27,046
Ko Dae-hwan.

211
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:30,216
He's dead to me.

212
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:34,470
Why do you keep trying to bring him back
to life? Are you Jesus?

213
00:17:35,263 --> 00:17:36,556
-Excuse me.
-<i>Ju-ri.</i>

214
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:40,476
If you're so desperate,
come and get the signature yourself.

215
00:18:03,207 --> 00:18:04,500
What's wrong? What is it?

216
00:18:05,001 --> 00:18:07,754
-What happened?
-She wants me to go to her.

217
00:18:09,255 --> 00:18:10,757
Is she out of her mind or what?

218
00:18:10,840 --> 00:18:12,967
If she's not sane, she should come here.

219
00:18:13,343 --> 00:18:14,427
Ms. Park.

220
00:18:15,428 --> 00:18:16,971
Let me hear about his medical history.

221
00:18:20,600 --> 00:18:22,769
The patient in room 203 with dementia.

222
00:18:22,852 --> 00:18:23,686
Oh, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan?

223
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:28,232
He needs to get surgery
due to his glioblastoma relapse.

224
00:18:28,316 --> 00:18:29,776
But his guardian doesn't care?

225
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:33,279
This patient has been with us
for the longest period of time.

226
00:18:33,363 --> 00:18:36,783
But his guardian
never once visited or called

227
00:18:36,866 --> 00:18:39,035
which means he's being neglected.

228
00:18:39,744 --> 00:18:43,206
So instead of just
calling his ungrateful guardian,

229
00:18:43,289 --> 00:18:45,375
why don't you actually visit her in person

230
00:18:45,458 --> 00:18:47,668
so that we can save the patient?

231
00:18:47,752 --> 00:18:48,961
What?

232
00:18:49,545 --> 00:18:52,006
Is that really necessary?

233
00:18:52,090 --> 00:18:55,385
You're going to do it, right?
I know you're a professional.

234
00:18:56,969 --> 00:18:59,847
If you let me take the rest of the day
and tomorrow off,

235
00:19:00,723 --> 00:19:02,684
-I'll go see her myself.
-Why do you need two days?

236
00:19:03,309 --> 00:19:05,269
Do you have a boyfriend in Seoul?

237
00:19:07,021 --> 00:19:08,147
I guess you do.

238
00:19:08,231 --> 00:19:10,983
Ju-ri, you have a boyfriend?

239
00:19:11,901 --> 00:19:12,735
No.

240
00:19:12,819 --> 00:19:15,571
Well then, I'll be off soon.

241
00:19:18,533 --> 00:19:20,660
I bet she does have a boyfriend.

242
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:22,578
She's a traitor.

243
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:54,277
I don't think your daughter
will be able to come here.

244
00:20:03,828 --> 00:20:05,788
No... No.

245
00:20:05,872 --> 00:20:07,165
What's the matter?

246
00:20:08,750 --> 00:20:10,501
No!

247
00:20:13,921 --> 00:20:15,131
Die.

248
00:20:16,758 --> 00:20:19,385
If she comes...

Yes?

252
00:20:46,162 --> 00:20:48,498

253
00:20:49,457 --> 00:20:51,584
-She even slapped me.
-My gosh.

You should make sure
the day doesn't get worse.

255

Kim Seung-cheol, the patient in isolation,
will be transferred to the police.

256
00:20:58,341 --> 00:21:00,760
Yes, I heard. I'll take care of him.

257
00:21:01,677 --> 00:21:04,597
We had a team dinner last night,
and we made a bet.

258
00:21:05,431 --> 00:21:06,307
"A bet"?

259
00:21:06,891 --> 00:21:08,768
"Why does Moon Gang-tae

260
00:21:08,851 --> 00:21:11,938
move from hospital to hospital every year
instead of settling down?"

261
00:21:12,021 --> 00:21:13,397
We tried to guess the answer.

262
00:21:14,398 --> 00:21:15,483
Number one.

263
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,111
Because you lost all your money,
and you're getting chased by loan sharks.

264
00:21:19,195 --> 00:21:22,323
Number two.
You got yourself in big trouble,

265
00:21:22,406 --> 00:21:24,742
and you're working here
to hide your identity from the cops.

266
00:21:24,826 --> 00:21:29,080
Number three. You always get kicked out
of every hospital you work at

267
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:31,290
for hitting on the nurses and patients.

268
00:21:33,125 --> 00:21:34,293
Which one did you bet on?

269
00:21:34,919 --> 00:21:35,920
I bet on

270
00:21:36,963 --> 00:21:37,964
number three. Women.

271
00:21:38,548 --> 00:21:40,174
So what's the answer?

272
00:21:44,679 --> 00:21:45,721
Number four.

273
00:21:52,436 --> 00:21:53,312
Men.

274
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:57,567
Gang-tae. My gosh.

275
00:21:58,484 --> 00:21:59,819

Again? You need to stop eating noodles.

00:22:57,251 --> 00:23:00,296
-What are you doing?
-I'm drawing.

297
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,840
You're drawing on that woman's book again.

298
00:23:02,923 --> 00:23:05,843
It's not "that woman."
She's writer Ko Mun-yeong.

299
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:09,430
Yes, Ko Mun-yeong.

300
00:23:10,765 --> 00:23:12,308
She's coming to our hospital today.

301
00:23:14,894 --> 00:23:17,229
She'll be reading her book
to the children at our hospital.

302
00:23:20,149 --> 00:23:21,150
Sang-tae?

303
00:23:21,942 --> 00:23:25,112
I'll go. I'll go there.
I'll go there right now.

304
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,739
I'll take bus number 243, the blue bus,

305
00:23:26,822 --> 00:23:29,075
get off at Jayang three-way intersection,
and take 5413,

306
00:23:29,158 --> 00:23:30,910
-<i>the green bus.</i>
-Sang-tae. No, wait.

307
00:23:31,035 --> 00:23:33,704
Get off at Myungsung University
Medical Center and walk--

308
00:23:33,729 --> 00:23:34,771
Moon Sang-tae!

309
00:23:39,585 --> 00:23:40,795
Take three deep breaths.

310
00:23:53,015 --> 00:23:53,933
Listen to me carefully.

311
00:23:54,016 --> 00:23:56,852
Even if you leave now,
you won't be able to make it on time.

312
00:23:56,936 --> 00:23:59,313
Plus, it's only for the patients
in the children's ward.

313
00:23:59,689 --> 00:24:01,565
But you're not a child, are you?

314
00:24:01,649 --> 00:24:04,735
Moon Sang-tae. 35 years old.
Born in 1984, the year of the rat.

315
00:24:04,819 --> 00:24:06,821
I'm younger than I look,
but I'm not a child.

316
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,072
<i>Exactly. You're an adult.</i>

317
00:24:08,572 --> 00:24:11,784
But instead,
I'll get you an autograph if I can.

318
00:24:13,202 --> 00:24:16,038
Meeting her is just a one-time thing,
but her autograph will last forever.

319
00:24:17,164 --> 00:24:18,708
Now, which one do you think is better?

320
00:24:18,791 --> 00:24:19,750
Her autograph.

321
00:24:23,921 --> 00:24:25,506
Who do you like more? Me or Ko Mun-yeong?

322
00:24:34,724 --> 00:24:37,101
Hello? Sang-tae?

323
00:24:46,143 --> 00:24:48,728
I didn't want to ruin her mood
prior to the big event.

324
00:24:48,812 --> 00:24:50,313
That's why I kept it quiet.

325
00:24:51,273 --> 00:24:53,733
I was going to convince her
and take her there

326
00:24:53,817 --> 00:24:56,611
after she successfully finished
today's reading.

327
00:24:56,695 --> 00:24:57,988
Darn it. I totally messed up.

328
00:25:00,824 --> 00:25:01,908
I'm getting a bad feeling.

329
00:25:01,992 --> 00:25:05,328
Why does Ms. Ko hate her father so much?

330
00:25:05,412 --> 00:25:07,706
She hates everyone apart from herself.

331
00:25:07,789 --> 00:25:10,500
Don't even ask why.
That's just how she was born.

332
00:25:11,084 --> 00:25:13,628
If you want to live a long life,
just stay quiet.

333
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:18,300
Gosh, where in the world is she?
It's almost time.

334
00:25:34,733 --> 00:25:35,859
Excuse me.

335
00:25:44,826 --> 00:25:46,828
-Can you please--
-This is my last one.

336
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:49,498
No, I don't want one. Can you put it out?

337
00:25:50,081 --> 00:25:51,291
I just lit it up.

338
00:25:51,374 --> 00:25:53,084
This is a non-smoking area, so put it out.

339
00:26:39,339 --> 00:26:42,342
Do you believe in destiny?

340
00:26:43,260 --> 00:26:45,387
-What?
-You heard me.

341
00:26:49,683 --> 00:26:51,142
Who cares about destiny?

342
00:26:53,311 --> 00:26:56,690
If someone shows up when you need them,

343
00:26:57,691 --> 00:26:58,900
you call that destiny.

345
00:27:22,757 --> 00:27:24,926
Gosh, that was so loud.

346
00:27:29,973 --> 00:27:32,726
Very realistic, isn't it?
She's good at acting, too.

347
00:27:42,611 --> 00:27:47,115
"The boy woke up
from another awful nightmare.

348
00:27:50,577 --> 00:27:53,622
Bad memories from the past
that he wanted to erase from his head

349
00:27:54,205 --> 00:27:56,625
were replayed in his dreams every night

350
00:27:56,708 --> 00:27:59,544
and haunted him nonstop.

351
00:28:03,131 --> 00:28:04,966
The boy was terrified of falling asleep.

352
00:28:05,050 --> 00:28:08,511
So one day,
he went to the witch and begged.

353
00:28:10,430 --> 00:28:14,100
'Please get rid of all my bad memories

354
00:28:14,934 --> 00:28:18,271
so that I won't ever have
a nightmare again.

355
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:24,277
Then I will do everything you ask.'"

356
00:28:27,614 --> 00:28:28,615
Go-eun!

357
00:28:29,199 --> 00:28:32,077
-Go-eun!
-My goodness, what's wrong with you?

358
00:28:32,827 --> 00:28:34,079
Where is Go-eun?

359
00:28:35,246 --> 00:28:36,456
Go-eun!

360
00:28:38,833 --> 00:28:41,836
Go-eun... Where is Go-eun?

361
00:28:42,796 --> 00:28:45,423
Seagull 777. I repeat. Seagull 777.

00:28:57,227 --> 00:28:58,103
Hello.

365
00:28:58,269 --> 00:28:59,354
And lie on your stomach.

366
00:29:01,898 --> 00:29:02,774
Let's try one more.

367
00:29:02,857 --> 00:29:04,025
-Are you serious?
-Sorry.

368
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,694
He said it was uncomfortable
so I took it off for a bit.

369
00:29:05,777 --> 00:29:06,903
Did you bring the restraint straps?

370
00:29:07,487 --> 00:29:08,655
Oh, I forgot.

371
00:29:16,413 --> 00:29:18,832
Look to your right and hold onto your arm.

372
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,377
Now, let's try it one more time.

373
00:29:25,422 --> 00:29:27,882
"Years went by,
and the boy became an adult.

374
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,468
-He no longer had nightmares.
-Go-eun.

375
00:29:30,552 --> 00:29:34,764
But for some strange reason,
he wasn't happy at all."

376
00:29:35,598 --> 00:29:37,183
-Go-eun.
-What's your problem?

377
00:29:37,267 --> 00:29:38,810
-What's going on?
-Go-eun.

378
00:29:39,436 --> 00:29:41,104
Go-eun.

379
00:29:41,187 --> 00:29:42,480
Gosh, what are you doing?

380
00:29:43,231 --> 00:29:45,775
"One night, a blood moon
filled the night sky,

381
00:29:45,859 --> 00:29:47,736
and the witch finally showed up again

382
00:29:47,819 --> 00:29:51,156
to take what he had promised
in return for granting his wish.

383
00:29:51,239 --> 00:29:55,243
And he shouted at her
with so much resentment.

384
00:29:56,202 --> 00:29:58,872
'All my bad memories are gone.

385
00:30:00,540 --> 00:30:01,374
But why...

386
00:30:02,250 --> 00:30:04,711
Why can't I become happy?'

387
00:30:05,503 --> 00:30:08,715
Then the witch took his soul
as they had promised,

388
00:30:09,299 --> 00:30:10,633
and told him this."

389
00:30:13,803 --> 00:30:15,555
-What's going on?
-Mom!

390
00:30:15,638 --> 00:30:18,016
What the hell is happening?

391
00:30:19,267 --> 00:30:23,438
We unfortunately have to end this here
due to unforeseen circumstances.

392
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:26,316
All hospital staff and guardians,
please take all children

00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,443
-back to the children's ward immediately.
-My gosh.

394
00:30:28,526 --> 00:30:30,779
-What's going on?
-Go-eun.

395
00:30:30,862 --> 00:30:32,489
Go-eun.

396
00:30:33,656 --> 00:30:35,909
-This isn't over yet.
-Go-eun.

397
00:30:36,409 --> 00:30:37,327
Kids, it's not over.

398
00:30:37,410 --> 00:30:39,204
-Come on.
-Go on.

399
00:30:39,287 --> 00:30:42,040
-Damn it.
-Gosh.

400
00:30:42,123 --> 00:30:43,708
-Mom!
-Mom, I'm scared.

401
00:30:43,792 --> 00:30:44,793
Okay, let's go.

402
00:30:46,503 --> 00:30:47,378
Hello?

403
00:30:48,671 --> 00:30:49,672
Damn it.

404
00:30:49,923 --> 00:30:51,508
Go up.

405
00:30:51,633 --> 00:30:53,218
-Hey!
-Let's go up.

406
00:30:53,468 --> 00:30:55,345
Wait! Wait up.

407
00:30:56,137 --> 00:30:57,889
Go-eun! My gosh, Go-eun...

408
00:30:58,765 --> 00:30:59,808
Come with Daddy.

409
00:30:59,891 --> 00:31:01,559
-Who are you to abruptly end this?
-No!

410
00:31:01,643 --> 00:31:03,645
-Right before the highlight of the event.
-Let me--

411
00:31:03,728 --> 00:31:05,688
Is it time to wrap up saying,
"to be continued"?

412
00:31:05,772 --> 00:31:08,316
-It's okay. It's all right.
-No, you're scaring me.

413
00:31:08,399 --> 00:31:09,484
Bring the kids back.

414
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:11,486
Come on. Let's go.

415
00:31:11,569 --> 00:31:13,196
There are only a few lines left,

416
00:31:14,197 --> 00:31:15,990
so they can leave after hearing the rest.

417
00:31:16,491 --> 00:31:17,909
-You should evacuate--
-Now!

418
00:31:29,879 --> 00:31:32,382
Dad, don't be like this.

419
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,467
I'm scared.

420
00:31:36,261 --> 00:31:37,178
Listen to me carefully.

421
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:40,515
If we get caught here, I'll be locked away
in a mental institution,

422
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,433
and you'll end up in an orphanage.

423
00:31:42,517 --> 00:31:44,978
Will you be okay
if you can never see Daddy again?

424
00:31:45,061 --> 00:31:47,772
I want to live. I don't want to die.

425
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:49,941
I told you.

426
00:31:50,024 --> 00:31:52,819
Kids can never live on their own.

427
00:31:53,653 --> 00:31:54,988
If we must be separated like this,

428
00:31:55,071 --> 00:31:56,990
we should just die together.
That'd be better.

429
00:31:58,491 --> 00:31:59,617
What the...

430
00:32:02,579 --> 00:32:03,621
That's such bullshit.

431
00:32:06,457 --> 00:32:09,294
You're the first worthless human being
I've encountered in a long time.

432
00:32:10,712 --> 00:32:12,005
Look at that gross, slimy face.

433
00:32:12,797 --> 00:32:14,549
Who are you? Do you have a death wish?

434
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:16,384
Have you ever killed anyone?

435
00:32:18,928 --> 00:32:20,722
You don't think
you can get on with your life,

436
00:32:20,805 --> 00:32:23,308
yet you can't even muster up the courage
to die alone.

437
00:32:24,142 --> 00:32:26,978
That's why you're trying to lure this kid
into going down that road first.

438
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:28,438
What?

439
00:32:29,772 --> 00:32:33,568
Don't be such a loser.
Go ahead and take your life alone.

440
00:32:34,152 --> 00:32:35,486
You crazy bitch!

441
00:32:46,497 --> 00:32:47,916
A knife...

442
00:32:51,878 --> 00:32:53,004
Hey!

443
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,010
You piece of...

444
00:33:17,236 --> 00:33:19,572
-Are you all right?
-My dad is...

445
00:33:27,163 --> 00:33:30,458
Hey! Who are you to meddle in my business?

446
00:33:30,917 --> 00:33:32,210
She's my child.

447
00:33:32,293 --> 00:33:35,004
I can kill her if I want to.
I can do whatever I want with her!

448
00:33:35,630 --> 00:33:38,675
Choke me. Choke me harder, you moron.

449
00:33:38,800 --> 00:33:40,093
You lunatic!

450
00:33:40,635 --> 00:33:43,471
Die. Just die!

451
00:33:52,188 --> 00:33:53,773
It'll be quick.

452
00:33:54,482 --> 00:33:59,153
It'll just be a moment.
It'll end even before you know it.

453
00:34:04,075 --> 00:34:06,744
Die. Just die.

454
00:34:07,245 --> 00:34:09,664
-Die!
-Mr. Kim Seung-cheol!

455
00:34:13,334 --> 00:34:15,795
Let go. Get off me!

456
00:34:16,296 --> 00:34:17,672
You piece of...

457
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:20,216
Come here.

458
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,690
Let go. Let go of me!

459
00:34:37,567 --> 00:34:40,153
Let go, you bastard! I'll kill you all!

460
00:34:40,236 --> 00:34:42,739
-Let go!
-I'm doing this so that you won't be hurt,

461
00:34:42,822 --> 00:34:43,698
so just calm down!

462
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,534
I'll kill you all. I'm going to kill...

00:35:58,481 --> 00:36:00,983
<font color="#ffff80"><i>THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES </i></font>

464
00:36:02,735 --> 00:36:03,736
So it wasn't destiny

465
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:06,072
after all.

466
00:36:10,118 --> 00:36:12,120
I'd appreciate it
if you could stay out of this.

467
00:36:12,995 --> 00:36:14,080
Let go of the knife first.

468
00:36:15,790 --> 00:36:17,542
This man is a patient.

469
00:36:17,625 --> 00:36:19,001
No.

470
00:36:19,794 --> 00:36:20,753
He is not a patient.

471
00:36:23,673 --> 00:36:24,715
He's vermin.

472
00:36:27,135 --> 00:36:28,219
What in the world...

473
00:36:28,469 --> 00:36:30,513
She's completely nuts.

474
00:36:31,514 --> 00:36:32,849
She's insane!

475
00:36:40,898 --> 00:36:42,066
That crazy bitch.

476
00:36:42,525 --> 00:36:44,444
I nearly died because of that bitch!

477
00:36:45,278 --> 00:36:47,697
Let go. Let go of me, you idiots.

478
00:36:47,780 --> 00:36:50,741
Get her, not me.
She's the one who needs help!

479
00:36:50,825 --> 00:36:52,368
-Don't lose him.
-Let go, you bastards!

480
00:36:53,035 --> 00:36:55,079
I told you to get
that insane woman in there!

481
00:36:55,163 --> 00:36:56,456
-Let go!
-Gosh, stay still.

482
00:37:06,757 --> 00:37:09,135
Is the knife hurt? Why are you
wrapping that around the knife?

483
00:37:11,846 --> 00:37:14,599
If he's non compos mentis,
we can say I acted in self-defense.

484
00:37:15,183 --> 00:37:17,226
I just wanted to give him a small cut
with the knife,

485
00:37:17,310 --> 00:37:19,187
but you overreacted and hurt yourself.

486
00:37:21,105 --> 00:37:21,939
Here.

487
00:37:25,651 --> 00:37:27,111
Your hand, not the knife.

488
00:37:30,323 --> 00:37:32,074
Here's my special service.

489
00:37:33,075 --> 00:37:34,118
You know what?

490
00:37:34,994 --> 00:37:37,830
In this world,
there are people who deserve to die.

491
00:37:38,748 --> 00:37:40,875
But some thoughtful freaks

492
00:37:40,958 --> 00:37:43,461
kill them for us in secret.

493
00:37:44,212 --> 00:37:47,632
That is why the clueless civilians
can sleep peacefully at night,

494
00:37:48,549 --> 00:37:50,051
completely unaware of it.

495
00:37:54,055 --> 00:37:55,640
Which one do you think I am?

496
00:38:09,195 --> 00:38:10,404
You're

497
00:38:11,948 --> 00:38:12,782
a clueless freak.

498
00:38:27,088 --> 00:38:28,714
Oh, boy.

499
00:38:29,257 --> 00:38:32,301
Thanks to you, my suturing skills
are getting better by the day.

500
00:38:33,970 --> 00:38:36,556
Stop hurting yourself already.

501
00:38:41,269 --> 00:38:42,311
Mr. Moon?

502
00:38:43,646 --> 00:38:44,855
Mr. Moon Gang-tae.

503
00:38:46,148 --> 00:38:47,149
Yes?

504
00:38:47,900 --> 00:38:49,235
What were you thinking about?

505
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:53,948
It's done.

506
00:38:54,865 --> 00:38:57,368
Okay, fine.
The event turned into total chaos

507
00:38:57,451 --> 00:39:00,663
because of the patient who escaped,
so let's just consider it buzz marketing.

508
00:39:00,746 --> 00:39:03,499
But what about the knife fight?
How are you going to explain it?

509
00:39:03,708 --> 00:39:05,751
You said one of the hospital staff
got hurt.

510
00:39:05,835 --> 00:39:07,795
What if they distribute a press release?

511
00:39:08,087 --> 00:39:10,214
"A famous children's book author
brandished a knife.

512
00:39:10,298 --> 00:39:14,218
Is she working on a martial arts novel?"
You'll see the headlines everywhere.

513
00:39:14,302 --> 00:39:16,053
Just bribe them.
You've done it many times.

514
00:39:16,345 --> 00:39:18,222
What if that doesn't work? What do we do?

515
00:39:18,306 --> 00:39:19,974
We'll use a honey trap. I'll seduce them.

516
00:39:27,315 --> 00:39:28,357
Get in.

517
00:39:31,694 --> 00:39:33,696
You go ahead.
I have to take care of something.

518
00:39:34,447 --> 00:39:35,948
What do you need to do?

519
00:39:37,450 --> 00:39:38,784
Hey, Mun-yeong!

520
00:39:39,285 --> 00:39:41,329
Is she going to cause trouble again?

521
00:39:41,871 --> 00:39:42,705
<font color="#ffff80">ADMIN MANAGER</font>

522
00:39:42,788 --> 00:39:44,874
A patient who should have been
in solitary confinement

523
00:39:45,583 --> 00:39:47,376
barged in there and ruined the event.

524
00:39:48,294 --> 00:39:51,756
The guardians are calling to complain,
so the phones are ringing off the hook.

525
00:39:52,423 --> 00:39:56,093
We need to quickly find someone
who will take the bullet.

526
00:39:58,554 --> 00:40:00,973
Are you saying I should be that person?

527
00:40:01,557 --> 00:40:04,018
The one who was in charge
of the transfer is a newbie,

528
00:40:04,602 --> 00:40:06,479
so I can't really fire him.

529
00:40:07,480 --> 00:40:09,482
I see here that you've worked

530
00:40:10,066 --> 00:40:13,319
at so many different hospitals
in the past ten years.

531
00:40:13,527 --> 00:40:15,988
My gosh, 15 hospitals in total.

532
00:40:17,031 --> 00:40:18,741
And less than a year at all of them.

533
00:40:18,949 --> 00:40:20,451
You've been with us for ten months now,

534
00:40:21,660 --> 00:40:24,121
<i>so you'll be quitting soon anyway.</i>

so that you can get your severance pay.</i>

538
00:40:37,051 --> 00:40:38,427

539
00:40:55,778 --> 00:40:57,279
Hey, it's me.

540
00:40:57,905 --> 00:41:01,242
Get me the contact information of the guy
who got hurt because of Mun-yeong.

541
00:41:02,118 --> 00:41:03,494
What do you think?

542
00:41:03,744 --> 00:41:05,955
I need to bribe him or something
to silence him.

543
00:41:06,205 --> 00:41:07,456
Come on. You know the drill.

545
00:41:51,834 --> 00:41:53,085
I was delivering an order

546
00:41:53,210 --> 00:41:55,087
but saw a guy sitting here
looking like a sick chicken

547
00:41:55,171 --> 00:41:56,464
and knew it was you.

548
00:42:04,096 --> 00:42:05,598
Hop on. I'll give you a ride.

549
00:42:07,433 --> 00:42:08,517
You freak.

550
00:42:11,437 --> 00:42:12,855
You hurt yourself again?

551
00:42:31,499 --> 00:42:33,209
Damn it.

552
00:42:34,418 --> 00:42:36,003
Is he ignoring my calls?

553
00:42:37,713 --> 00:42:41,091
If he bled, I'm sure he'll sue her.

Hello, Ms. Nam.

556
00:42:50,976 --> 00:42:53,187
Oh, I see. You're already here?

557
00:42:54,563 --> 00:42:55,606
Right.

558
00:42:56,357 --> 00:42:58,192
The room number is...

559
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:01,820
Just a moment, please.

560
00:43:09,495 --> 00:43:10,955
Did you order room service?

561
00:43:17,002 --> 00:43:18,796
Where did he go?

562
00:44:10,222 --> 00:44:11,223
Thanks.

563
00:44:18,897 --> 00:44:21,191
Alberto, no. Don't do this to me.

564
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:23,360
No, Alberto. Don't be like this.
Please, Alberto!

565
00:44:23,444 --> 00:44:25,613
No! Don't do this to me, Alberto!

566
00:44:25,821 --> 00:44:27,156
-Shit.
-What's wrong?

567
00:44:27,239 --> 00:44:28,324
-Gosh!
-What's going on?

568
00:44:28,407 --> 00:44:30,743
Hang on. Alberto... Gosh!

569
00:44:32,745 --> 00:44:34,538
Alberto!

570
00:44:37,041 --> 00:44:38,542
Giddy-up!

571
00:44:38,626 --> 00:44:40,919
Alberto! Shit. Alberto, please...

572
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,047
Don't die.

573
00:44:46,300 --> 00:44:47,259
Gang-tae!

574
00:44:48,719 --> 00:44:50,137
I'm really okay.

575
00:44:50,596 --> 00:44:53,515
Your brother must be waiting for you,
so just take a cab home!

576
00:44:54,683 --> 00:44:56,477
I won't say that you ditched me!

577
00:44:57,353 --> 00:44:58,395
I totally understand!

578
00:44:58,979 --> 00:45:02,107
Because that is
what a true loyal friend would do!

579
00:45:02,650 --> 00:45:04,276
Shut it and just keep on pulling.

582
00:45:35,932 --> 00:45:37,434
You've changed so much.

583
00:45:38,143 --> 00:45:41,146
I almost couldn't recognize you
because you no longer look like a hick.

584
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:46,484
Has it been almost 20 years
since I transferred to a different school?

585
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:48,904
Yes.

586
00:45:50,739 --> 00:45:53,575
We just need your signature here.

587
00:45:54,075 --> 00:45:56,786
The doctor must've already
explained everything over the phone.

588
00:45:57,579 --> 00:45:59,456
You should actually do this in person--

589
00:45:59,539 --> 00:46:03,168
Hey, you traveled for three hours

590
00:46:03,251 --> 00:46:05,170
just to get my signature
on this stupid paperwork?

591
00:46:05,754 --> 00:46:08,632
Do you have a strong sense of duty?
Or are you just a do-gooder?

592
00:46:13,553 --> 00:46:16,765
Our hospital is a psychiatric clinic,

593
00:46:17,515 --> 00:46:20,227
so we have to work with another hospital
to perform surgery.

594
00:46:20,852 --> 00:46:23,521
-In your father's case--
-I told you that he's dead.

595
00:46:25,732 --> 00:46:27,901
I'm an orphan. You know that.

596
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:31,738
But your mother is alive--

597
00:46:31,821 --> 00:46:33,740
I registered her death a long time ago.

598
00:46:35,075 --> 00:46:36,952
Do you want to hear something interesting?

599
00:46:41,206 --> 00:46:45,126
My dad's soul is dead,

600
00:46:45,710 --> 00:46:47,921
but he's physically alive like a zombie.

601
00:46:50,173 --> 00:46:51,299
As for my mom,

602
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:54,469
she physically died many years ago.

603
00:46:56,054 --> 00:46:56,888
However,

604
00:47:01,226 --> 00:47:04,896
her soul is still alive.

605
00:47:13,238 --> 00:47:15,782
So between the two of them,
who's really dead?

606
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:19,452
Tell me, nurse.
Which one of them is really dead?

607
00:47:21,329 --> 00:47:22,539
Your father...

608
00:47:23,832 --> 00:47:25,792
I mean, Mr. Ko Dae-hwan.

609
00:47:25,875 --> 00:47:28,837
He may end up in critical condition
if he doesn't undergo surgery this time.

610
00:47:29,337 --> 00:47:30,547
His cognitive functions--

611
00:47:30,630 --> 00:47:33,383
Hey, others will think
that you're his daughter.

612
00:47:34,134 --> 00:47:36,720
Oh, why don't we do that?
You can be Ko Dae-hwan's daughter.

613
00:47:36,803 --> 00:47:38,305
I'll be your mom's daughter.

614
00:47:38,471 --> 00:47:41,141
I'll sign this consent form
if you agree to that.

615
00:47:41,308 --> 00:47:42,142
What do you say?

616
00:48:13,381 --> 00:48:15,050
Your mom is a good cook.

617
00:48:16,009 --> 00:48:19,137
Shall I come over for some food
like the good old days?

618
00:48:22,891 --> 00:48:24,851
I see that you still don't get my jokes.

619
00:48:27,103 --> 00:48:28,396
You're no fun.

620
00:48:32,233 --> 00:48:34,277
She pisses me off.

621
00:48:35,904 --> 00:48:37,238
She's insane.

622
00:48:37,322 --> 00:48:39,324
I can't believe she writes
children's literature.

623
00:48:39,407 --> 00:48:40,992
That's bizarre.

624
00:48:41,076 --> 00:48:42,619
No, she's not "insane."

625
00:48:44,162 --> 00:48:45,622
She was just born that way.

626
00:48:45,705 --> 00:48:48,458
Goodness. Can you diagnose people
at a glance

627
00:48:48,541 --> 00:48:50,460
now that you've worked
at mental hospitals for ten years?

628
00:48:51,294 --> 00:48:52,504
Stop overreacting.

629
00:48:52,587 --> 00:48:55,048
You fool, can you please learn
to overreact a little?

630
00:48:57,550 --> 00:49:00,095
You got fired with a knife injury
because of those lunatics.

631
00:49:00,178 --> 00:49:01,554
I can't believe you just left.

632
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:03,973
-You should've caused a scene.
-Had I done that,

633
00:49:06,351 --> 00:49:07,560
it would've felt nice,

634
00:49:09,104 --> 00:49:11,022
-but I wouldn't get my severance pay.
-Well done.

635
00:49:12,107 --> 00:49:15,318
Your brother got expelled from school,
and you got fired from work.

636
00:49:15,402 --> 00:49:17,153
You guys are two peas in a pod.

637
00:49:17,779 --> 00:49:19,489
It was about time I quit anyway.

638
00:49:25,620 --> 00:49:26,871
It's this time of the year.

639
00:49:27,956 --> 00:49:29,416
When the night breeze feels warm.

640
00:49:31,126 --> 00:49:32,127
I guess

641
00:49:34,671 --> 00:49:36,005
butterflies will appear soon.

642
00:49:40,385 --> 00:49:41,219
Right.

643
00:49:43,388 --> 00:49:46,558
How's Sang-tae? No signs yet?

644
00:49:48,309 --> 00:49:49,310
No, not yet.

645
00:49:50,311 --> 00:49:51,980
Then where should we go next?

646
00:49:54,983 --> 00:49:57,527
-Should we go to another country?
-Do you even have a passport?

647
00:49:58,027 --> 00:50:00,113
Sang-tae should learn English.

648
00:50:02,365 --> 00:50:03,241
Jae-su.

649
00:50:04,284 --> 00:50:05,743
Don't say anything to my brother.

650
00:50:05,827 --> 00:50:09,581
Gosh, you only care about your brother.
I'm sick of this.

651
00:50:10,248 --> 00:50:11,875
I'm so jealous.

652
00:50:13,168 --> 00:50:14,127
You scared me.

653
00:50:17,297 --> 00:50:19,340
What's wrong?
Did that woman also hit you in the head?

654
00:50:22,302 --> 00:50:24,596
The autograph.
I forgot to get her autograph.

655
00:50:25,096 --> 00:50:27,765
-I promised him I'd get it.
-She must've hit you hard in the head.

656
00:50:28,391 --> 00:50:29,225
What do I do, Jae-su?

657
00:50:30,351 --> 00:50:31,394
Oh, dear.

660
00:50:45,867 --> 00:50:48,703
Gosh, her autograph
looks like a bunch of heroglyphs.

661
00:50:49,787 --> 00:50:52,457
Hieroglyphs, not "heroglyphs."

662
00:50:54,959 --> 00:50:56,669
Hurry up. Sang-tae is waiting.

663
00:51:05,512 --> 00:51:07,138
Done. Have a look.

664
00:51:08,264 --> 00:51:10,016
Hey, look. It's very similar, isn't it?

665

Nice job, Jae-su!

-Yes.

This will make Sang-tae happy.

669
00:51:32,914 --> 00:51:34,582
Don't smile like that, dude.
It disgusts me.

670
00:51:37,335 --> 00:51:39,254
A patient said the same thing to me
earlier today.

671
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:42,215
Is my smile that annoying?

672
00:51:43,508 --> 00:51:44,342
You don't know?

673
00:51:45,843 --> 00:51:47,095
You really don't know?

674
00:51:48,263 --> 00:51:49,305
What?

675
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:50,515
When you smile,

676
00:51:52,934 --> 00:51:54,602
you look like the Joker.

677
00:51:54,686 --> 00:51:57,730
With those sad eyes and the corners
of your lips pointing up like this.

678
00:51:59,732 --> 00:52:00,942
Look in the mirror. You'll see.

679
00:52:06,447 --> 00:52:07,323
Come on, let's go.

680
00:52:15,873 --> 00:52:17,292
Sang-tae, I'm home.

681
00:52:25,174 --> 00:52:26,134
This...

682
00:52:28,970 --> 00:52:31,097
This is fake. It's fake.

683
00:52:31,180 --> 00:52:33,766
-No, it's her real autograph. It's--
-This is fake.

684
00:52:34,267 --> 00:52:35,435
-Gosh, that's...
-This is fake.

685
00:52:35,518 --> 00:52:38,146
-Sang-tae, wait.
-This is fake.

686
00:52:38,313 --> 00:52:41,482
-Gosh, that... Goodness.
-This is fake.

687
00:52:41,566 --> 00:52:44,986
This is fake, fake, fake. It's all fake.

688
00:52:45,069 --> 00:52:47,071
You lied to me.

689
00:52:47,655 --> 00:52:50,992
-Sang-tae, I'm sorry.
-You lied to me.

690
00:52:52,118 --> 00:52:53,119
You lied to me?

691
00:52:53,202 --> 00:52:55,288
-Lying is bad.
-Sang-tae, I was too busy today that...

692
00:52:55,371 --> 00:52:57,248
Lying is bad. You lied to me?

693
00:52:57,332 --> 00:52:59,542
Even little kids know
that it's wrong to lie.

694
00:52:59,626 --> 00:53:01,586
-Shall we go to the bookstore tomorrow?
-You lied?

695
00:53:01,669 --> 00:53:04,213
-Even three-year-olds--
-Shall we get the dinosaur encyclopedia?

696
00:53:04,297 --> 00:53:06,716
-What?
-You always wanted that book.

697
00:53:08,468 --> 00:53:11,262
-Sang-tae?
-You lied?

698
00:53:12,138 --> 00:53:14,641
You lied? Why did you lie to me?

699
00:53:14,724 --> 00:53:18,603
-Lying is bad.
-Gosh, you poor thing.

700
00:53:21,105 --> 00:53:23,566
This is all Ko Mun-yeong's fault.

701
00:53:23,650 --> 00:53:26,569
I'm going to burn all these books!
What is this?

702
00:53:26,653 --> 00:53:28,613
-Why would a boy feed on nightmares?
-No!

703
00:53:28,696 --> 00:53:30,281
-No, don't.
-I'll burn all these books.

704
00:53:30,365 --> 00:53:32,075
-No, you can't!
-Look, I'll...

705
00:53:32,158 --> 00:53:33,743
-No!
-No? Why not?

706
00:53:33,826 --> 00:53:36,287
-It's mine. Don't do this.
-No, I'll burn them all.

712
00:53:56,641 --> 00:53:58,643
<i>I'd like to speak with you</i>

713
00:53:58,726 --> 00:54:01,145
<i>if you can spare a moment
out of your busy schedule.</i>

714
00:54:01,229 --> 00:54:03,106
<i>It'd be greatly appreciated</i>

715
00:54:03,189 --> 00:54:05,858
<i>if you could stop by our office tomorrow.</i>

716
00:54:07,068 --> 00:54:09,904
<i>Please don't say no.</i>

717
00:54:10,238 --> 00:54:12,907
<i>I'd really like to meet you. Please.</i>

718
00:54:22,083 --> 00:54:24,252
-<i>Please!</i>
-Why would you read children's books?

719
00:54:24,335 --> 00:54:26,921
You don't understand art.
Art is such a beautiful thing.

720
00:54:27,004 --> 00:54:29,173
What do you mean I don't understand art?
Art is...

721
00:54:29,257 --> 00:54:31,509
Naughty erotica books are what I call art.

722
00:54:31,592 --> 00:54:33,845
-This is...
-Go away. Just go home.

723
00:54:33,928 --> 00:54:36,055
-Just leave.
-Come on, Sang-tae. I like you so much.

724
00:54:40,101 --> 00:54:42,311
Of course. I knew it. Let's see.

725
00:54:44,605 --> 00:54:45,565
<i>Sure.</i>

726
00:54:46,441 --> 00:54:47,442
"Sure"?

727
00:54:47,942 --> 00:54:49,110
Gosh, that doesn't sound good.

728
00:54:49,193 --> 00:54:50,820

733
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:03,124
<i>The police are investigating his death
at the moment.</i>

734
00:55:03,583 --> 00:55:06,210
<i>It is said that he caused a scene
at a book reading event</i>

735
00:55:06,294 --> 00:55:08,546
<i>which was organized
for pediatric patients in the hospital,</i>

736
00:55:08,629 --> 00:55:12,216

737
00:55:44,665 --> 00:55:48,127
He has such beautiful eyes.

738
00:56:00,306 --> 00:56:01,265
<i>Do you know this?</i>

739
00:56:02,225 --> 00:56:05,394
In this world,
there are people who deserve to die.

740
00:56:05,478 --> 00:56:09,607
But some thoughtful freaks
kill them for us in secret.

741
00:56:09,690 --> 00:56:13,152
That is why the clueless civilians
can sleep peacefully at night,

742
00:56:14,153 --> 00:56:15,154
completely unaware of it.

743
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:31,295

I told you not to look down on me.

744
00:56:32,505 --> 00:56:34,006
Yes, I won't.

745
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,926
-Stop him.
-Okay, go back to sleep.

01:08:01,735 --> 01:08:04,780
as well as to make sure
you won't tell anyone about it?

859
01:08:08,242 --> 01:08:09,868
I guess this method has always worked.

860
01:08:10,077 --> 01:08:11,537
Verbal consolation is useless.

861
01:08:11,620 --> 01:08:12,955
Money is the best.

862
01:08:14,665 --> 01:08:15,582
Not to me.

863
01:08:16,500 --> 01:08:18,418
Then what do you want? Sex?

864
01:08:19,836 --> 01:08:21,088
Is it worth more than money?

865
01:08:24,591 --> 01:08:25,801
Then why are you here?

866
01:08:25,884 --> 01:08:27,094
If not for money or sex,

867
01:08:27,177 --> 01:08:29,012
what are you here for?

868
01:08:33,809 --> 01:08:35,143
I was hoping

869
01:08:38,981 --> 01:08:40,440
I could see you again.

870
01:08:41,775 --> 01:08:42,860
That's why I'm here.

871
01:08:46,572 --> 01:08:47,614
Your eyes.

872
01:08:49,449 --> 01:08:51,326
I wanted to see them again.

873
01:08:54,955 --> 01:08:55,789
My eyes?

874
01:08:57,332 --> 01:08:58,333
Your eyes

875
01:09:01,169 --> 01:09:03,380
remind me of someone I used to know.

876
01:09:07,301 --> 01:09:08,385
Who is that person?

877
01:09:11,179 --> 01:09:12,556
Someone who's messed up

878
01:09:16,143 --> 01:09:18,145
<i>and has no conscience.</i>

879
01:09:19,271 --> 01:09:20,522
A woman

880
01:09:22,149 --> 01:09:23,400
<i>whose eyes</i>

881
01:09:25,402 --> 01:09:26,653
completely lacked warmth.

882
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,037
That woman...

883
01:09:39,541 --> 01:09:40,542
Were you afraid of her?

884
01:09:45,547 --> 01:09:46,465
No, the opposite.

885
01:10:04,274 --> 01:10:05,359
I liked

886
01:10:06,568 --> 01:10:07,569
her.

887

<i>"Dear Sang-tae!</i>

892
01:11:24,187 --> 01:11:26,815
<i>It's boring to say that

893
01:11:26,898 --> 01:11:28,275
I thought I was on the run

894
01:11:28,900 --> 01:11:29,901
Don't touch my hair!

895
01:11:29,985 --> 01:11:31,403
because of my brother.

896
01:11:32,279 --> 01:11:33,488

Where is Ko Mun-yeong?

898
01:11:36,366 --> 01:11:38,827
You won't end up well
if you get involved with her.

899
01:11:39,411 --> 01:11:40,787
Don't go.

900
01:11:40,871 --> 01:11:42,748
<i>I want you to be my safety pin.</i>

901
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:46,418
Keep me under control
so that I won't explode.

3
00:00:15,352 --> 00:00:16,562
Then why are you here?

4
00:00:16,645 --> 00:00:19,690
If not for money or sex,
what are you here for?

5
00:00:21,734 --> 00:00:22,735
I was hoping

6
00:00:26,197 --> 00:00:27,865
I could see you again.

7
00:00:28,908 --> 00:00:29,742
That's why I'm here.

8
00:00:31,744 --> 00:00:32,745
Your eyes.

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:36,498
I wanted to see them again.

10
00:00:39,543 --> 00:00:40,586
My eyes?

11
00:00:41,837 --> 00:00:42,922
Your eyes

12
00:00:44,798 --> 00:00:47,009
remind me of someone I used to know.

13
00:00:49,803 --> 00:00:51,013
Who is that person?

14
00:00:53,057 --> 00:00:54,266
Someone who's messed up.

15
00:00:56,185 --> 00:00:58,229

16
00:01:00,981 --> 00:01:02,233
<i>Shall I help him?</i>

17
00:01:07,488 --> 00:01:08,405
<i>Or not?</i>

18
00:01:23,879 --> 00:01:24,838
Wait.

19
00:01:32,471 --> 00:01:33,430
A woman

20
00:01:36,392 --> 00:01:37,977
whose eyes

21
00:01:39,061 --> 00:01:40,229
completely lacked warmth.

22
00:01:47,278 --> 00:01:48,320
That woman...

23
00:01:52,574 --> 00:01:53,534
Were you afraid of her?

24
00:01:58,205 --> 00:01:59,498
No, the opposite.

25
00:02:58,766 --> 00:03:00,017
I liked her.

I remind you of the girl

00:03:29,922 --> 00:03:31,882
I never said they were beautiful memories.

31
00:03:48,273 --> 00:03:50,734

33
00:03:59,785 --> 00:04:01,537
I wouldn't call them good memories.

35
00:04:07,835 --> 00:04:08,752
But you know what?

00:04:09,586 --> 00:04:11,046
Bad memories

37
00:04:12,047 --> 00:04:15,300
stay here longer.

38
00:04:28,981 --> 00:04:31,984
Hey, I can't believe
you let them run into each other!

39
00:04:32,067 --> 00:04:33,652
You should've stopped Mun-yeong
at all costs.

40
00:04:33,861 --> 00:04:36,864
Well, Ms. Ko showed up unannounced.

41
00:04:37,406 --> 00:04:38,907
Does she ever give us a heads-up?

42
00:04:38,991 --> 00:04:40,826
Gosh, seriously.

43
00:04:40,909 --> 00:04:42,035
If you lack foresight,

44
00:04:42,119 --> 00:04:43,996
you should've done all you could
to stop them.

45
00:04:44,079 --> 00:04:46,248
Unbelievable! Why do I even pay you?

46
00:04:50,127 --> 00:04:51,837
I want to punch him, even just once.

47
00:04:58,635 --> 00:05:00,137
Go tell Mr. Lee that I understand

48
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:02,055
how tough his job must be.

49
00:05:02,139 --> 00:05:03,223
What?

50
00:05:03,307 --> 00:05:05,976
But he doesn't need
to go to such lengths for me,

51
00:05:06,059 --> 00:05:07,644
so tell him not to contact me again.

52
00:05:15,486 --> 00:05:16,820
My gosh.

53
00:05:17,654 --> 00:05:20,324
I'm very late, aren't I?
The traffic was awful.

54
00:05:20,407 --> 00:05:22,451
Why don't we have a chat
over some sweet beverage?

55
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:24,369
No, it's okay.

56
00:05:24,453 --> 00:05:25,829
Oh, you're leaving already?

57
00:05:25,913 --> 00:05:27,915
Don't forget to get Ms. Ko's autograph.

58
00:05:32,127 --> 00:05:33,545

59

-Well, that's--
-Earlier, you asked me

60
00:05:35,881 --> 00:05:39,343
to get Ms. Ko's autograph for you.

61
00:05:42,346 --> 00:05:44,014

62
00:05:44,097 --> 00:05:47,017
and that girl in your memories

63
00:05:48,185 --> 00:05:49,478
was all just for my autograph?

64
00:05:51,230 --> 00:05:52,064
No.

65
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:53,857
So you weren't after money or sex.

66
00:05:53,941 --> 00:05:56,610
My autograph was what you wanted.

67
00:05:56,944 --> 00:05:57,945
I said, no.

68
00:05:58,028 --> 00:05:59,780
My gosh, this is perfect.

69
00:05:59,863 --> 00:06:01,740

-I'll give you one.

71
00:06:04,284 --> 00:06:05,661
My autograph.

72
00:06:12,459 --> 00:06:15,003
This is my newest book, hot off the press.

73
00:06:16,964 --> 00:06:17,839

Who is Sang-tae? Is he your nephew?

79
00:06:36,692 --> 00:06:38,235
No, he's my brother.

80
00:06:38,318 --> 00:06:41,989
I see. Your brother is a fan of hers.

81
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:45,701
Right, Mun-yeong has fans of all ages

for the past ten years,

109
00:08:19,002 --> 00:08:21,129
and no one has ever said no to this.

110
00:08:22,047 --> 00:08:23,215
What an oddball.

00:08:24,174 --> 00:08:26,093

a bad feeling about this.

00:08:27,427 --> 00:08:29,179

two boxes instead of one?

113
00:08:45,862 --> 00:08:47,239
Beautiful.

114
00:08:50,242 --> 00:08:51,368

115
00:09:18,478 --> 00:09:19,563

you want to be given a proper task.

Yes, just tell me what you need.
I'll do anything.

120
00:09:46,590 --> 00:09:49,509
Do some digging on the man who just left.

121
00:09:53,263 --> 00:09:56,099
-Pardon?
-If you tell Mr. Lee,

122
00:09:58,018 --> 00:10:00,520

00:13:46,913 --> 00:13:48,623
How do I look cool?

183
00:14:01,886 --> 00:14:03,471
Cool facial expressions.

184
00:14:12,522 --> 00:14:13,898
-The beer is on the house.
-Well...

185
00:14:13,982 --> 00:14:16,234
I have to go back this evening,
so I shouldn't drink.

186
00:14:16,318 --> 00:14:18,028
-How about Coke?
-Sure, I'll drink Coke.

187
00:14:24,784 --> 00:14:26,077
This is also on the house.

188
00:14:32,000 --> 00:14:34,377
I heard you transferred
to a hospital in the countryside.

189
00:14:35,503 --> 00:14:36,671
Right.

190
00:14:37,881 --> 00:14:39,716
<font color="#ffff80">RETAIL SPACE FOR LEASE</font>

191
00:14:39,799 --> 00:14:43,136
By the way, are you moving again?

192
00:14:43,720 --> 00:14:46,598
Well, you know.
I refuse to be tied down to one place.

193
00:14:46,681 --> 00:14:49,017
I'm like the last nomad in this country.

194
00:15:08,661 --> 00:15:11,122
Well... All is good, right?

195
00:15:12,290 --> 00:15:13,792
Yes, as you can see.

196
00:15:14,751 --> 00:15:15,752
No, I mean...

197
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:18,630
Gang-tae.

198
00:15:22,008 --> 00:15:25,887
<i>Yes. He's doing well,
getting joy out of overworking himself.</i>

199
00:15:31,351 --> 00:15:32,560
Did you hurt your hand?

200
00:15:33,728 --> 00:15:36,022
-No, I'm okay.
-Take it easy.

201
00:15:36,106 --> 00:15:37,982
Your wage won't go up
even if you work that hard.

202
00:15:38,066 --> 00:15:41,569
They say one must seek out hard work
while still young, but that's bullshit.

203
00:15:41,653 --> 00:15:44,364
Gosh, you'll see when you're older.

204
00:15:44,739 --> 00:15:48,118
You'll suffer from body aches all over
and get sick all the time.

205
00:15:55,542 --> 00:15:58,586
That young man is so unyielding.

206
00:16:26,823 --> 00:16:28,533
All right, let's start the meeting.

207
00:16:28,616 --> 00:16:29,617
-Okay.
-Yes, sir.

208
00:16:30,743 --> 00:16:32,829
I'll start with the reviews.

209
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:34,330
Most reviewers said

210
00:16:34,414 --> 00:16:38,543
that the illustrations are too grotesque.

211
00:16:39,711 --> 00:16:43,548
Ms. Ko's other books were also criticized
for being too cruel.

212
00:16:43,631 --> 00:16:46,342
I think the illustrations are adding
to that this time, so I'm worried.

213
00:16:46,426 --> 00:16:47,844
Right. Then we should--

214
00:16:47,927 --> 00:16:49,179
Just leave it the way it is.

215
00:16:50,013 --> 00:16:52,182
Yes, we'll just leave it the way it is.

216
00:16:52,265 --> 00:16:53,558
All right, what's next?

217
00:16:54,142 --> 00:16:57,312
About Ms. Ko's book that will be adapted
into an animated film in the US...

218
00:16:57,395 --> 00:16:59,022
You mean, <i>The Ugly Dog's Puppy</i>?

219
00:16:59,105 --> 00:17:00,023
Right.

220
00:17:00,106 --> 00:17:01,983
They called and said

221
00:17:02,692 --> 00:17:05,278
that they want to change the dog character
to a cat.

222
00:17:05,361 --> 00:17:08,198
Tell them to keep it as is. If they
change it, I will annul the contract.

223
00:17:08,281 --> 00:17:11,910
Mun-yeong, then we'll suffer big losses...

224
00:17:12,118 --> 00:17:13,494
Then would you rather suffer death?

225
00:17:14,829 --> 00:17:17,540
Hey, Seung-jae! How could you think
it's okay to turn a dog into a cat

226
00:17:17,624 --> 00:17:19,167
without the author's permission?

227
00:17:19,250 --> 00:17:20,585
They're different species.

228
00:17:20,668 --> 00:17:23,129
Tell them to stick
to the original characters and plot.

229
00:17:24,088 --> 00:17:25,423
Hey, are you leaving?

230
00:17:27,926 --> 00:17:30,845
Make sure the book signing event tomorrow
lasts no more than an hour.

231
00:17:32,680 --> 00:17:35,099
As with anything else,
the faster we get it done, the better.

232
00:17:37,018 --> 00:17:38,061
<font color="#ffff80">YOO SEUNG-JAE</font>

233
00:17:38,645 --> 00:17:39,479
Okay, Seung-jae?

234
00:17:46,903 --> 00:17:47,904
Hello?

235
00:17:48,613 --> 00:17:51,199
Uncle, I need you to do
a background check on someone.

236
00:17:51,282 --> 00:17:54,786
I know you shouldn't do stuff like that
when you have sworn to protect and serve.

237
00:17:54,869 --> 00:17:57,664
Then do you know anyone who works
at the National Intelligence Service

238
00:17:57,747 --> 00:18:00,083
or at a private detective agency?

239
00:18:01,167 --> 00:18:02,001
Hello?

240
00:18:04,254 --> 00:18:06,548
Gosh, what do I do?

241
00:18:10,093 --> 00:18:11,261
Thanks for your hard work.

242
00:18:11,636 --> 00:18:14,222
You're so capable and efficient.
I'm sad that you're leaving.

243
00:18:14,889 --> 00:18:15,807
Gang-tae.

244
00:18:17,141 --> 00:18:18,142
Someone's looking for you.

245
00:18:52,771 --> 00:18:53,856
What happened to your hand?

246
00:18:56,525 --> 00:18:58,360
I hurt it a little while working.

247
00:19:09,913 --> 00:19:11,582
I'm all sweaty.

248
00:19:16,962 --> 00:19:19,757
Jae-su told me
that I'd be able to find you here.

249
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:21,091
I see.

250
00:19:22,051 --> 00:19:23,844
I heard you're moving again.

251
00:19:25,304 --> 00:19:27,890
You can leave whenever you want
without being attached to places.

252
00:19:28,432 --> 00:19:29,308
I envy you for that.

253
00:19:32,895 --> 00:19:34,897
Have you decided
which hospital to work at?

254
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:37,900
I'm sure I'll find a job somewhere.

255
00:19:39,151 --> 00:19:40,736
I'm not sure if it's a good thing or not,

256
00:19:41,236 --> 00:19:43,322
but they keep building
new psychiatric hospitals.

257
00:19:45,240 --> 00:19:47,785
The hospital I work at is looking
for an experienced caregiver.

258
00:19:49,578 --> 00:19:52,081
It's called OK Psychiatric Hospital.

259
00:19:52,331 --> 00:19:53,624
Eight-hour rotating shifts.

260
00:19:53,707 --> 00:19:55,667
You'll get ten days off each month,

261
00:19:55,751 --> 00:19:59,254
so you can pick up a part-time job
on the side if you'd like.

262
00:19:59,338 --> 00:20:03,759
And you're a certified nursing assistant,
so you'll get extra pay.

263
00:20:05,010 --> 00:20:06,178
Where is the hospital?

264
00:20:06,762 --> 00:20:08,847
In Seongjin City, our hometown.

265
00:20:09,431 --> 00:20:12,184
You said you also lived there
when you were little.

266
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:14,895
A bunch of areas have been redeveloped,

267
00:20:14,978 --> 00:20:16,814
so it no longer has that small-town vibe.

268
00:20:16,897 --> 00:20:21,568
Also, a multiplex theater
opened recently and...

269
00:20:36,542 --> 00:20:38,502
Mom.

270
00:20:39,795 --> 00:20:41,839
Mom!

271
00:20:43,090 --> 00:20:45,634
Bring my mom back.

272
00:20:46,468 --> 00:20:47,719
Mom.

273
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:50,472
Mom, no.

274
00:20:50,556 --> 00:20:52,933
-Mom, open your eyes.
-The butterfly did it.

275
00:20:53,016 --> 00:20:55,352
I mean, I saw it.

276
00:20:55,436 --> 00:20:56,436
-Mom!
-The butterfly...

277
00:20:57,354 --> 00:20:58,564
Mom, no.

278
00:20:58,647 --> 00:21:00,941
-Mom, please open your eyes.
-The butterfly

279
00:21:01,024 --> 00:21:02,568
killed Mom.

280
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:04,486
The butterfly...

281
00:21:05,904 --> 00:21:08,866
The butterfly killed her.

282
00:21:09,533 --> 00:21:10,701
I saw it.

283
00:21:11,493 --> 00:21:12,911
The butterfly did it.

284
00:21:15,581 --> 00:21:17,833
Sang-tae! Tell us exactly what you saw.

285
00:21:17,916 --> 00:21:18,959
Was it a man or a woman?

286
00:21:19,042 --> 00:21:20,377
How old?

287
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:22,087
What did this person look like?

288
00:21:22,171 --> 00:21:23,130
Did you hear the voice?

289
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:26,258
The butterfly said it'd kill me as well

290
00:21:27,134 --> 00:21:29,136
if I didn't keep my lips sealed.

291
00:21:29,720 --> 00:21:31,889
It said it'd chase me down

292
00:21:33,348 --> 00:21:35,809
and kill me!

293
00:21:38,312 --> 00:21:40,397
We should send the younger one
to a children's home

294
00:21:40,981 --> 00:21:45,777
and his older brother to a center that
takes care of children with special needs.

295
00:21:46,778 --> 00:21:49,656
That would probably be best for them both.

296
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,533
Okay. We'll leave him in your hands, then.

297
00:21:53,952 --> 00:21:55,370
Sang-tae, let's go.

298
00:22:00,083 --> 00:22:01,210
Come on.

299
00:22:11,929 --> 00:22:13,513
Where are we headed?

300
00:22:14,806 --> 00:22:16,725
To a place where the butterfly
can't find us.

301
00:22:19,186 --> 00:22:20,187
Somewhere far?

302
00:22:21,313 --> 00:22:22,606
Yes, far away.

303
00:22:48,006 --> 00:22:48,840
You must be tired.

304
00:22:50,634 --> 00:22:52,052
You didn't have to come with me.

305
00:22:53,553 --> 00:22:55,973
Get on the bus. You'll arrive very late.

306
00:22:57,057 --> 00:22:58,433
Bye, then.

307
00:23:05,816 --> 00:23:07,109
Hey, Gang-tae.

308
00:23:07,943 --> 00:23:09,653
There's an empty room at my place.

309
00:23:10,696 --> 00:23:11,530
I mean...

310
00:23:12,614 --> 00:23:14,366
No one uses the room.

311
00:23:14,616 --> 00:23:16,326
My mom and I only use the first floor.

312
00:23:17,619 --> 00:23:20,872
If you actually end up
moving back to Seongjin City,

313
00:23:20,956 --> 00:23:23,834
you won't have to look for a place.

314
00:23:27,087 --> 00:23:28,630
Bye now, for real.

315
00:23:37,556 --> 00:23:39,224
Thanks for your concern,

316
00:23:41,184 --> 00:23:42,519
but I won't be moving there.

317
00:23:42,602 --> 00:23:44,062
Why not?

318
00:23:46,481 --> 00:23:47,774
Because it's in the countryside?

319
00:23:51,486 --> 00:23:52,487
Yes.

320
00:23:53,989 --> 00:23:55,073
That's why.

321
00:24:20,599 --> 00:24:22,768
<i>Ju-ri, I don't know if you know this. </i>

322
00:24:24,895 --> 00:24:26,980
Gang-tae, that poor thing,

323
00:24:29,232 --> 00:24:31,651
never builds deep relationships.

324
00:24:32,235 --> 00:24:34,821
He'll leave eventually anyway,

325
00:24:35,030 --> 00:24:38,992
so he thinks it's pointless to build
a relationship that will only last a year.

326
00:24:48,835 --> 00:24:50,462
-Why does he keep...
-Right,

327
00:24:52,547 --> 00:24:54,049
but why does he have to leave?

328
00:24:54,674 --> 00:24:55,842
It's because...

329
00:24:55,926 --> 00:24:57,260
What's the reason?

330
00:24:57,344 --> 00:24:59,721
You see, it's all...

331
00:25:03,100 --> 00:25:07,396
It's all because of that damn butterfly.

332
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:09,314
Darn it.

333
00:25:13,402 --> 00:25:14,403
"Butterfly"?

334
00:25:27,332 --> 00:25:28,417
A butterfly?

335
00:25:48,311 --> 00:25:49,563
See you again.

336
00:25:50,230 --> 00:25:51,440

Right, Jae-su. When will he be here?

361
00:28:17,085 --> 00:28:19,337
Gosh, Jae-su...

362
00:28:19,921 --> 00:28:21,548

Oh, no! It's cold!

Look left and right. Be safe.
Safety comes first.

Look at those blue pants. Blue jeans.

Good. When you're getting
her autograph later,

I'll be watching you
from exactly that distance,

385
00:30:53,825 --> 00:30:55,702
-so get that woman's autograph--
-Author Ko Mun-yeong?

386
00:30:55,785 --> 00:30:58,121
That's right.
After you get Ko Mun-yeong's autograph

387
00:30:58,204 --> 00:31:00,874
and take a picture with her,
we'll head home right away.

388
00:31:01,166 --> 00:31:02,625
Then what will you get?

389
00:31:02,709 --> 00:31:04,002
Buy me the dinosaur encyclopedia.

00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,130
Sang-tae, don't run. Sang-tae!

391
00:31:07,672 --> 00:31:09,591
-Let's go.
-Slow down.

392
00:31:28,943 --> 00:31:30,070
-Wait, Sang-tae.
-What?

393
00:31:30,236 --> 00:31:31,321
You must wait in line.

394
00:31:32,906 --> 00:31:34,032
-Wait here, okay?
-Okay.

395
00:31:34,699 --> 00:31:36,409
-I'll be over there.
-Okay.

396
00:31:37,911 --> 00:31:39,287
Okay, let's go.

397
00:31:40,997 --> 00:31:42,373
I'm getting her autograph.

And her daughter

My goodness, what brings

405
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:27,752
Of course I should be here

I have to say, it's really impressive.

411
00:32:42,892 --> 00:32:45,311
Do you think
it's because of Ko Mun-yeong's looks?

412
00:32:45,395 --> 00:32:47,856
Gosh, come on.
It's not because of her looks.

413
00:32:47,939 --> 00:32:49,357
It's because she's a great writer.

414
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:51,943
All right, let's not stand around here.

415
00:32:52,026 --> 00:32:53,820
Why don't we go somewhere

416
00:32:53,903 --> 00:32:55,363
and drink something sweet?

417
00:32:55,446 --> 00:32:57,407
-Let's go.
-Goodness, what's with you?

418
00:32:57,490 --> 00:32:59,909
Come on. It's okay.

419
00:33:01,119 --> 00:33:02,912
Why are you being like this? I'm diabetic.

420
00:33:03,037 --> 00:33:05,790
Come on. You'll be fine. Excuse us.

421
00:33:25,810 --> 00:33:27,186
The sun is...

422
00:33:27,770 --> 00:33:28,771
What time is it? What?

423
00:33:28,855 --> 00:33:30,523
What time is it? I'm late!

424
00:33:33,276 --> 00:33:34,861
What the fuck, 18 calls?

425
00:33:34,944 --> 00:33:36,988
I'm so dead.

426
00:33:37,071 --> 00:33:38,698
Shit, what do I do?

427
00:33:43,286 --> 00:33:44,579
Jeez.

428
00:33:47,790 --> 00:33:49,876
-Sang-tae, I have to take a call.
-Okay.

429
00:33:49,959 --> 00:33:51,294
-Stay right here, okay?
-Okay.

430
00:33:59,552 --> 00:34:00,511
Gosh!

431
00:34:00,803 --> 00:34:03,890
My, it's a stegosaurus.
A real stegosaurus. Hi, stegosaurus.

432
00:34:03,973 --> 00:34:05,391
-A stegosaurus.
-My gosh.

433
00:34:05,475 --> 00:34:08,436
This is a stegosaurus.
The name means "roofed lizard."

434
00:34:08,519 --> 00:34:09,854
It's okay. You don't need to come.

435
00:34:09,938 --> 00:34:10,980
The plates.

436
00:34:11,064 --> 00:34:13,358
Stegosaurus is characterized
by the plates along the back.

437
00:34:13,441 --> 00:34:16,027
It's estimated that they lived
during the late Jurassic Period.

438
00:34:16,110 --> 00:34:17,779
-The scientists--
-What's wrong with him?

439
00:34:17,862 --> 00:34:18,821
What's with you?

440
00:34:18,905 --> 00:34:22,116
My gosh, this stegosaurus is huge!

441
00:34:22,200 --> 00:34:24,911
It has a small brain
despite its large size--

442
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:26,454
Get lost!

443
00:34:27,830 --> 00:34:28,998
-My gosh.
-Oh, no!

444
00:34:29,082 --> 00:34:30,959
I have a plush toy
that looks just like it.

445
00:34:31,167 --> 00:34:34,087
Here, this looks just like it.
This is my stegosaurus toy.

446
00:34:34,170 --> 00:34:37,799
Its name is Teary--

447
00:34:37,924 --> 00:34:39,592
-I'm being too nice, aren't I?
-My hair.

448
00:34:39,676 --> 00:34:40,760
-Get out.
-My hair.

449
00:34:40,843 --> 00:34:42,428
-My hair. Let go!
-Get out.

450
00:34:42,512 --> 00:34:43,846
-I said, get out!
-My hair...

451
00:34:43,930 --> 00:34:45,139
-Get out.
-No, my hair!

452
00:34:45,306 --> 00:34:46,557
Don't touch my hair!

453
00:34:46,683 --> 00:34:49,519
My hair... Don't touch my hair.

454
00:34:50,270 --> 00:34:52,146
My hair... Don't touch my hair.

455
00:34:52,230 --> 00:34:54,732
Don't touch my hair.
My hair... Don't touch my hair.

456
00:34:54,816 --> 00:34:57,151
My hair! Don't touch my hair!

457
00:34:57,235 --> 00:34:59,570
Don't touch my hair. Go away.

458
00:35:00,822 --> 00:35:03,116
Don't touch my hair. Go away!

459
00:35:09,205 --> 00:35:10,748
Sorry, excuse me.

460
00:35:12,917 --> 00:35:15,503
-Go away!
-Sang-tae, it's okay.

461
00:35:15,920 --> 00:35:17,839
-No, my hair...
-Sang-tae, I'm sorry.

462
00:35:17,922 --> 00:35:19,590
-He grabbed my hair...
-I'm sorry, Sang-tae.

463
00:35:19,674 --> 00:35:21,634
-You're okay now.
-I'm okay.

464
00:35:21,718 --> 00:35:24,637
-It's okay. I'm sorry.
-I'm okay.

465
00:35:24,721 --> 00:35:28,141
-You're okay now, Sang-tae.
-I'm okay now. I'm sorry.

466
00:35:28,266 --> 00:35:32,020
I'm okay now.

467
00:35:32,103 --> 00:35:34,022
I'm okay now. I'm sorry.

468
00:35:34,105 --> 00:35:35,106
It's okay.

469
00:35:35,356 --> 00:35:37,233
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

471
00:35:40,653 --> 00:35:41,821

Hey!

475
00:36:08,181 --> 00:36:09,265
You need to apologize.

476
00:36:13,436 --> 00:36:14,479
You.

477
00:36:15,271 --> 00:36:16,272
Apologize.

478
00:36:18,608 --> 00:36:22,028
-Why should I apologize to him?
-No, to me.

479
00:36:22,111 --> 00:36:23,196
What?

480
00:36:23,279 --> 00:36:26,240
You totally ruined my book signing event.

481
00:36:26,324 --> 00:36:29,035
Why is that my fault?
This fucking dumbass--

482
00:36:29,118 --> 00:36:30,495
Goodness!

483
00:36:30,578 --> 00:36:31,788
Gosh!

484
00:36:32,330 --> 00:36:35,708
Who wouldn't scream when someone
grabs them by the hair like this?

485
00:36:38,711 --> 00:36:40,880
See? You're screaming too.

486
00:36:40,963 --> 00:36:42,882
Let go. I said, let go!

487
00:36:44,342 --> 00:36:46,552
-Let go.
-Listen.

488
00:36:46,677 --> 00:36:48,221
This lunatic was harassing our son.

489
00:36:48,304 --> 00:36:50,473
-What did you expect? Just watch?
-Shit. I'm so screwed.

490
00:36:50,848 --> 00:36:53,559
Are you a psychiatrist?
How do you know that he's a lunatic?

491
00:36:53,643 --> 00:36:55,311
Well, that's...

492
00:36:56,687 --> 00:36:59,565
I can tell because he kept

493
00:36:59,649 --> 00:37:02,193
rambling on about things
that make no sense!

494
00:37:02,944 --> 00:37:04,112
Crazy bitch.

495
00:37:04,195 --> 00:37:06,072
-My gosh.
-Did she really just say that?

496
00:37:06,155 --> 00:37:07,281
-What's with her?
-Goodness.

497
00:37:07,365 --> 00:37:08,533
What did you just say?

498
00:37:08,825 --> 00:37:11,869
Well, you kept rambling on
about things that make no sense,

499
00:37:12,370 --> 00:37:14,205
so I thought you were crazy.

500
00:37:16,833 --> 00:37:19,502
My gosh. Honey, you heard that, right?

501
00:37:19,585 --> 00:37:23,005
You all heard that, right?
She swore at me just now.

502
00:37:23,089 --> 00:37:24,632
What are you people doing? Record this!

503
00:37:24,715 --> 00:37:26,551
Yes! Record a video!

504
00:37:26,634 --> 00:37:27,718
-I'm speechless.
-Film this!

505
00:37:27,802 --> 00:37:29,262
I'm utterly speechless.

506
00:37:42,275 --> 00:37:46,320
I'm okay. I'm not a bad person.

507
00:37:48,573 --> 00:37:49,907
I'm not a bad person.

508
00:37:51,951 --> 00:37:54,537
I'm not a bad person.

<font color="#ffff80">INVENTORY</font>

510
00:38:02,545 --> 00:38:03,880
Shouldn't you check on him?

511
00:38:04,213 --> 00:38:06,090
He'll let me in when he's calmed down.

512
00:38:06,174 --> 00:38:07,550
When would that be?

513
00:38:08,342 --> 00:38:09,385
Usually in an hour.

514
00:38:09,468 --> 00:38:11,971
A day or two at the most.

515
00:38:17,643 --> 00:38:19,020
Then what? I have to stay here all night?

516
00:38:22,773 --> 00:38:24,066
No, I never asked you to.

517
00:38:25,193 --> 00:38:27,236
Don't worry.
Just go sort out the situation.

518
00:38:27,320 --> 00:38:29,864
"Don't worry"?
Why would I worry? About whom?

519
00:38:36,871 --> 00:38:39,415
By the way, the back of his head
must be very sensitive.

520
00:38:39,999 --> 00:38:43,002
Is that his erogenous zone or something?

521
00:38:43,961 --> 00:38:45,379
Oh, it's like a detonator.

522
00:38:45,463 --> 00:38:47,798
When it's set off, the bomb goes off.

523
00:38:47,882 --> 00:38:49,050
Then how does he get haircuts?

524
00:38:49,717 --> 00:38:53,137
Will he go like this again? "No!"

525
00:38:54,096 --> 00:38:55,473
Enough, okay?

526
00:38:57,475 --> 00:38:59,101
Now, you're looking at me in the eye.

527
00:39:19,455 --> 00:39:20,873
What are you doing?

528
00:39:22,041 --> 00:39:23,417
Don't wear hats.

529
00:39:24,710 --> 00:39:26,629
I can't see your pretty face.

530
00:39:32,885 --> 00:39:34,011
Why is your face turning red?

531
00:39:39,267 --> 00:39:41,519
Your forehead must be
your erogenous zone, right?

532
00:39:49,485 --> 00:39:51,862
Hey, Ms. Ko!

533
00:39:53,572 --> 00:39:54,907
You caused trouble again.

534
00:39:54,991 --> 00:39:58,160
Mr. Lee will be really stressed out
this time.

535
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:04,041
Gosh, seriously!

536
00:40:04,125 --> 00:40:08,462
Why does she get herself in trouble
whenever I'm not around?

537
00:40:10,214 --> 00:40:13,342
She acts up
whenever that caregiver shows up.

538
00:40:13,426 --> 00:40:15,386
Hey, if you knew that,

539
00:40:15,469 --> 00:40:18,097
why didn't you make sure
they wouldn't run into each other?

540
00:40:18,180 --> 00:40:20,558
Gosh, why do I even pay you?

541
00:40:26,897 --> 00:40:29,066
Hi, Reporter Kim.

542
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:31,652
Gosh, no. She never said, "Crazy bitch."

543
00:40:31,736 --> 00:40:34,071
She just said,
"Gosh, this is driving me crazy."

544
00:40:34,155 --> 00:40:36,991
People mishear things all the time,
you know.

545
00:40:39,577 --> 00:40:41,120
That fucking prick.

546
00:40:43,873 --> 00:40:44,999
Is he your boyfriend?

547
00:40:45,082 --> 00:40:47,376
My gosh, you're dating?

548
00:40:48,252 --> 00:40:50,504
If you got those boxes,
just shut up and leave.

549
00:40:51,005 --> 00:40:54,592
Gosh, you look exactly like your mother
now that you have a frown on your face.

550
00:40:55,301 --> 00:40:57,803
Your mother was not only a great writer,

551
00:40:57,887 --> 00:41:00,264
but she was also very sexy.

552
00:41:01,599 --> 00:41:04,101
You have a lot in common with your mother.

553
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:10,775
Cut the nonsense and just leave.

554
00:41:11,901 --> 00:41:13,027
Things might be great now,

555
00:41:14,945 --> 00:41:16,947
but I advise you to be careful.

556
00:41:17,448 --> 00:41:21,035
Her mother, who was a famous writer,

557
00:41:21,452 --> 00:41:23,371
suddenly passed away
without a single warning.

558
00:41:24,622 --> 00:41:27,375
And her father, who was
a successful architect, suddenly went nuts

559
00:41:27,958 --> 00:41:30,419
and got locked up
in a psychiatric hospital.

560
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:34,048
Then what do you think will happen to you?

561
00:41:36,509 --> 00:41:39,178
You won't end up well
if you get involved with her.

562
00:41:40,846 --> 00:41:41,764
Keep that in mind.

563
00:41:54,276 --> 00:41:55,152
Let me go.

564
00:42:02,827 --> 00:42:03,828
Don't go.

565
00:42:10,292 --> 00:42:11,585
Do you like me?

566
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:15,005
Are you going to look after me?

567
00:42:15,714 --> 00:42:17,133
Do you think you can handle it?

568
00:42:17,216 --> 00:42:18,843
Who are you to stop me?

569
00:43:07,892 --> 00:43:09,018
I was right.

570
00:43:10,019 --> 00:43:11,729
I knew you'd come after me.

571
00:43:12,563 --> 00:43:15,191
I've been reading your books
for quite a long time now.

572
00:43:16,150 --> 00:43:17,443
And when you read someone's book,

573
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:20,654
you can easily see
how that writer thinks and feels.

574
00:43:22,114 --> 00:43:26,160
Then I guess you also know
what I'm going to do next.

575
00:43:28,788 --> 00:43:30,414
Don't mess with me.

576
00:43:30,748 --> 00:43:32,124
I won't go down alone.

577
00:43:32,750 --> 00:43:36,045
I'll take you and Mr. Lee down with me.

578
00:43:36,962 --> 00:43:39,298
Why do you think they call me
the Suicide Bomber?

579
00:43:39,882 --> 00:43:41,800
Isn't it because you're a jerk
who never goes down

580
00:43:41,884 --> 00:43:43,594
without taking others with you?
Isn't that right?

581
00:43:45,387 --> 00:43:47,723
I can destroy your career
with the tip of my pen.

582
00:43:48,682 --> 00:43:50,100
I'm sure you know that.

583
00:43:50,184 --> 00:43:54,855
A famous children's book writer
actually turned out to have

584
00:43:54,939 --> 00:43:56,732
an antisocial personality disorder?

585
00:43:58,484 --> 00:44:01,195
What do you think will happen
when people find out?

586
00:44:05,616 --> 00:44:06,742
What do you want?

587
00:44:07,284 --> 00:44:09,537
I'm starting to get tired and bored

588
00:44:11,163 --> 00:44:12,414
of receiving these boxes.

589
00:44:13,916 --> 00:44:15,834
I think it'd be nice

590
00:44:18,087 --> 00:44:21,131
if you'd be kind enough

591
00:44:22,716 --> 00:44:23,926
to humor me a little.

592
00:44:34,562 --> 00:44:35,813
That's easy.

593
00:44:38,399 --> 00:44:39,316
But I, too,

594
00:44:46,532 --> 00:44:48,033
can attack you with the tip of my pen.

595
00:45:07,344 --> 00:45:08,637
Goodbye.

596
00:45:27,364 --> 00:45:28,240
<font color="#ffff80">911 EMERGENCY</font>

597
00:45:29,908 --> 00:45:31,952
You evil bitch!

598
00:45:32,286 --> 00:45:36,707
You just wait! I swear I'll get rid of...

599
00:45:36,790 --> 00:45:38,125
Loosen your neck, sir.

600
00:45:44,173 --> 00:45:46,592
Damn, he should've just died.

601
00:45:46,675 --> 00:45:49,887
Why do all jerks have a long lifespan?

602
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:50,971
Damn it.

603
00:45:51,639 --> 00:45:52,473
Stop right there.

604
00:45:57,728 --> 00:45:58,812
What are you doing?

605
00:46:00,147 --> 00:46:01,273
Take in a deep breath.

606
00:46:05,235 --> 00:46:06,070
Deeper.

607
00:46:10,240 --> 00:46:11,825
-What are you--
-Close your eyes.

608
00:46:18,624 --> 00:46:20,417
When you can't control yourself,

609
00:46:24,380 --> 00:46:26,757
cross your arms like this

610
00:46:26,840 --> 00:46:28,759
and take turns
tapping on each shoulder like this.

611
00:46:32,096 --> 00:46:34,723
This will help you calm down.

612
00:46:38,477 --> 00:46:41,021
What is this?

613
00:46:41,814 --> 00:46:43,107
The Butterfly Hug Method.

614
00:46:49,780 --> 00:46:53,075
<i>It's a self-healing technique
that's recommended for trauma patients.</i>

615
00:47:01,834 --> 00:47:03,794
It's no fun to have you stand behind me.

616
00:47:11,260 --> 00:47:12,553
A trauma

617
00:47:13,512 --> 00:47:15,472
should be faced head-on like this

618
00:47:15,889 --> 00:47:17,599
instead of trying to soothe it
from behind.

619
00:47:56,013 --> 00:47:57,473
Why are you running away?

620
00:47:58,307 --> 00:47:59,516
I'm going to my brother.

621
00:47:59,600 --> 00:48:01,268
Slow down. My feet hurt.

622
00:48:02,311 --> 00:48:03,145
Hey.

623
00:48:03,896 --> 00:48:04,772
Hey.

624
00:48:04,855 --> 00:48:05,773
Hey!

625
00:48:09,818 --> 00:48:11,695
Don't make me get angry. I'll explode.

626
00:48:11,779 --> 00:48:13,322
That's why I taught you
the butterfly hug method.

627
00:48:13,405 --> 00:48:14,782
That stuff is useless.

628
00:48:16,200 --> 00:48:18,577
-I want you to be my safety pin.
-What?

629
00:48:19,077 --> 00:48:22,206
Keep me under control
so that I won't explode.

630
00:48:22,289 --> 00:48:23,791
You told me to mind my own business.

631
00:48:23,874 --> 00:48:25,375
You told me I had no right to stop you.

632
00:48:25,459 --> 00:48:26,460
You hold grudges.

633
00:48:26,543 --> 00:48:27,836
Yes, that's right.

634
00:48:29,087 --> 00:48:30,422
So I'm giving you the right to be

635
00:48:30,506 --> 00:48:32,382
Ko Mun-yeong's safety pin.

636
00:48:32,466 --> 00:48:34,384
Why would I be your safety pin?

637
00:48:35,135 --> 00:48:36,345
Because you're a caregiver.

638
00:48:37,930 --> 00:48:40,808
Isn't it your job to keep an eye
on potential patients and care for them?

639
00:48:44,812 --> 00:48:46,063
Go and ask someone else.

640
00:48:47,314 --> 00:48:49,608
I'll pay you a lot of money.
How much do you want?

641
00:48:55,072 --> 00:48:58,075
There's something we always say
to patients who fully recover.

642
00:48:59,201 --> 00:49:00,035
What's that?

643
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:02,663
"Hope I never see you again."

644
00:49:05,082 --> 00:49:06,083
Please.

645
00:49:08,043 --> 00:49:08,961
Let's not meet again.

646
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:11,797
I really want you to stop.

647
00:49:12,381 --> 00:49:13,382
Stop following me.

648
00:49:25,435 --> 00:49:26,854
But I'm not a patient.

649
00:49:29,022 --> 00:49:30,482
"Hope I never see you again."

650
00:49:30,566 --> 00:49:33,485
That's what you say to your patients.
But I'm fine.

651
00:49:34,236 --> 00:49:35,237
You're right.

652
00:49:36,071 --> 00:49:37,990
You're different from patients.

653
00:49:38,782 --> 00:49:39,658
Exactly.

654
00:49:40,242 --> 00:49:42,286
Drugs and injections can't cure you.

655
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:45,163
You were just born that way.

656
00:49:45,747 --> 00:49:49,042
So there's no way to treat you.
And you have a poor prognosis.

657
00:49:51,378 --> 00:49:52,254
It's just best

658
00:49:53,046 --> 00:49:55,048
to avoid people like you.

659
00:50:02,764 --> 00:50:04,141
You're not avoiding me.

660
00:50:04,725 --> 00:50:07,811
You're just running away
because you're scared.

661
00:50:11,481 --> 00:50:12,941
You coward.

662
00:50:37,299 --> 00:50:38,425
Hey.

663
00:51:08,789 --> 00:51:09,790
Do you

664
00:51:11,917 --> 00:51:13,001
still like me?

665
00:51:32,562 --> 00:51:33,689
Coward.

666
00:51:48,453 --> 00:51:49,496
Mun-yeong.

667
00:51:49,705 --> 00:51:51,957
How are you going to deal with this?

668
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,209
There were tons of witnesses!

669
00:51:54,292 --> 00:51:57,379
Why are you always ruining your own career
that you worked for?

670
00:51:57,462 --> 00:51:59,548
What were you doing?
You were smoking, weren't you?

671
00:52:00,090 --> 00:52:01,550
-Yes.
-My gosh, come on.

672
00:52:01,633 --> 00:52:02,676
Mun-yeong!

673
00:52:02,759 --> 00:52:06,638
Why don't you just kill me?

674
00:52:15,897 --> 00:52:16,898
Sang-tae.

675
00:52:36,334 --> 00:52:38,587
Are you upset
that you didn't get her autograph?

676
00:52:41,840 --> 00:52:43,383
If you keep looking so upset,

677
00:52:45,093 --> 00:52:46,553
you're going to make my heart ache.

678
00:52:53,602 --> 00:52:55,854
-Gosh, my stomach.
-Why does your stomach hurt?

679
00:52:55,937 --> 00:52:57,689
-My stomach...
-Your stomach... 911...

680
00:52:57,773 --> 00:52:58,899
-My stomach...
-Call 911.

681
00:52:59,524 --> 00:53:00,358
Surprise!

682
00:53:01,985 --> 00:53:03,153
<i>The Dinosaur Encyclopedia.</i>

683
00:53:03,737 --> 00:53:05,530
<i>The Dinosaur Encyclopedia!</i>

684
00:53:05,614 --> 00:53:07,157
It's <i>The Dinosaur Encyclopedia!</i>

685
00:53:07,365 --> 00:53:08,950
<i>The Dinosaur Encyclopedia!</i>

686
00:53:10,702 --> 00:53:12,704
<i>The Dinosaur Encyclopedia.</i>

687
00:53:13,705 --> 00:53:14,539
Are you happy?

688
00:53:14,623 --> 00:53:17,000
Yes, I'm happy. I'm really happy.

689
00:53:20,128 --> 00:53:22,089
Who do you like more? Me or Ko Mun-yeong?

690
00:53:22,672 --> 00:53:25,759
"Maiasaura's name means
'good mother reptile' in Latin.

691
00:53:25,842 --> 00:53:27,886
It's a herbivorous dinosaur
with a duck-like beak.

692
00:53:27,969 --> 00:53:30,388
Dromaeosaurus' name means
'swift running lizard',

693
00:53:30,472 --> 00:53:32,599
and it got its name due to its fast speed.

694
00:53:32,682 --> 00:53:35,227
It's about 35cm big when it hatches
from the mother's egg,

695
00:53:35,310 --> 00:53:38,522
and it grows up to 3m in just a year.
Maiasaura. Maiasaura.

696
00:53:38,605 --> 00:53:42,234
Maiasauras lived in herds
and took care of their infants

697
00:53:42,317 --> 00:53:44,736
until they grew up to about one meter.

698
00:53:44,820 --> 00:53:47,114
Maisaura means 'good mother reptile'.

699
00:53:48,949 --> 00:53:51,076
Bagacera... Bagaceratops.

700
00:53:51,159 --> 00:53:52,994
It means 'small-horned face'.

701
00:53:53,078 --> 00:53:54,996
Bagaceratops."

702
00:53:59,417 --> 00:54:00,710
What are you doing?

703
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:02,587
Don't wear hats.

704
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:05,799
I can't see your pretty face.

705
00:54:14,057 --> 00:54:15,684
It's a reptile.

706
00:54:17,435 --> 00:54:20,355
"Bagaceratops is a dinosaur with horns.

707
00:54:20,438 --> 00:54:23,358
It has a small body and short tail.

708
00:54:23,441 --> 00:54:25,944
Bagaceratops lived in the desert

709
00:54:26,027 --> 00:54:29,072
and dug holes in the sand
to lay eggs there.

710
00:54:29,156 --> 00:54:30,699
A dinosaur with small horns.

711
00:54:31,199 --> 00:54:33,660
A dinosaur with ghastly claws,

712
00:54:33,743 --> 00:54:35,829
Baryo... Baryonyx."

713
00:54:40,375 --> 00:54:41,209
<font color="#ffff80">EMERGENCY AMBULANCE</font>

714
00:54:41,293 --> 00:54:44,087

on your way there.

715
00:54:44,171 --> 00:54:45,297
What about the epinephrine?

716
00:54:45,380 --> 00:54:47,382
I have some ready just in case.

717
00:54:47,591 --> 00:54:49,759
Do you have the list of medications
and medical history card?

718
00:54:50,093 --> 00:54:51,094
Here.

719
00:54:51,386 --> 00:54:53,263
Thanks. I'll be off now.

720
00:54:54,472 --> 00:54:55,307
Let's get going.

721
00:54:56,600 --> 00:54:57,601
Good luck.

722
00:55:04,649 --> 00:55:06,568
"It is very nimble and fast.

723
00:55:06,651 --> 00:55:08,236
Dromaeosaurus' name means

724
00:55:08,320 --> 00:55:10,197
-'swift running lizard..."
-Sang-tae.

725
00:55:10,280 --> 00:55:11,281
Sang-tae!

726
00:55:11,948 --> 00:55:12,949
"Its body and tail..."

727
00:55:13,033 --> 00:55:15,327
I told you not to get distracted
when you're walking.

728
00:55:16,203 --> 00:55:18,330
Don't you remember you got hit by a car
and got hospitalized?

729
00:55:20,749 --> 00:55:22,042
-Give it to me.
-No!

730
00:55:24,002 --> 00:55:25,003
Give me that.

731
00:55:25,545 --> 00:55:26,796
You can read it at home.

732
00:55:27,756 --> 00:55:28,757
-Come on.
-No.

733
00:55:28,840 --> 00:55:31,051
-It's dangerous.
-Look!

734
00:55:33,011 --> 00:55:35,263
-Sang-tae! No, don't run.
-I'll be safe. Let's be safe.

735
00:55:35,347 --> 00:55:37,974
-Don't run. It's dangerous.
-Slowly. Let's take my time.

736
00:55:40,852 --> 00:55:43,188
-Look.
-You can't fool me again. Give it to me.

737
00:55:43,271 --> 00:55:45,607
Jae-su... It's Jae-su.

738
00:56:05,210 --> 00:56:06,211
You know me, right?

739
00:56:07,379 --> 00:56:09,547
Even a ton of beer
can't make me get drunk.

740
00:56:11,508 --> 00:56:14,844
But it's weird how I get so easily drunk
whenever I drink with a woman.

741
00:56:16,012 --> 00:56:19,516
A long time ago, a wise man once said,

742
00:56:20,350 --> 00:56:23,812
"History is made at night
with alcohol and a woman."

743
00:56:25,105 --> 00:56:26,398
But my history

744
00:56:29,025 --> 00:56:31,861
is going to be pitch dark.

745
00:56:33,613 --> 00:56:34,739
Utterly dark.

746
00:56:36,700 --> 00:56:37,701
Jae-su.

747
00:56:37,909 --> 00:56:38,827
Yes?

748
00:56:39,869 --> 00:56:40,954
It's time that you stop.

749
00:56:41,454 --> 00:56:42,914
Stop what?

750
00:56:44,207 --> 00:56:45,959
Living a hard life by following us around.

751
00:56:51,381 --> 00:56:53,091
You should settle down
and live comfortably.

752
00:56:55,844 --> 00:56:57,637
What's your problem? That's up to me.

753
00:56:57,721 --> 00:56:59,431
Who are you to decide what I should do?

754
00:56:59,514 --> 00:57:01,391
I'll decide when it's time for me
to stop or not.

755
00:57:01,474 --> 00:57:02,934
What's the matter with you?

756
00:57:05,228 --> 00:57:06,313
Did something happen?

757
00:57:06,938 --> 00:57:08,481
Why are you so sentimental today?

758
00:57:09,274 --> 00:57:10,900
That darn woman, Ko Mun-yeong.

759
00:57:10,984 --> 00:57:13,528
That crazy woman did something again,
didn't she?

760
00:57:14,821 --> 00:57:16,906
-No.
-Don't lie to me.

761
00:57:17,490 --> 00:57:20,493
-No, she didn't.
-She obviously did.

762
00:57:20,577 --> 00:57:22,579
You never mean it when you say "no."

763
00:57:22,662 --> 00:57:23,622
What did she do?

764
00:57:27,876 --> 00:57:29,252
I thought I was on the run

765
00:57:31,546 --> 00:57:33,089
because of my brother.

766
00:57:34,090 --> 00:57:35,550
The butterflies and all.

767
00:57:36,843 --> 00:57:39,638
I thought we were being chased
by something that doesn't even exist

768
00:57:41,973 --> 00:57:43,558
all because of Sang-tae.

769
00:57:44,768 --> 00:57:45,977
Well, it's true.

770
00:57:47,062 --> 00:57:48,897
But today, for the first time,

771
00:57:49,856 --> 00:57:51,066
I suddenly thought

772
00:57:53,234 --> 00:57:54,903
maybe I was just running away

773
00:57:57,530 --> 00:57:59,741
because I wanted to.

774
00:58:01,576 --> 00:58:02,786
That's not true.

775
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:07,207
You see,

776
00:58:10,043 --> 00:58:11,961
when life is unbearably hard,

777
00:58:15,757 --> 00:58:17,342
the easiest way out is to run.

778
00:58:48,581 --> 00:58:49,999
<i>THE BOY WHO FED ON NIGHTMARES </i>

779
00:58:50,750 --> 00:58:53,086
This is Ms. Ko Mun-yeong's book.

780
00:58:55,463 --> 00:58:57,173
Ko Mun-yeong.

781
00:58:57,257 --> 00:58:59,342
Sang-tae, do you remember

782
00:59:00,093 --> 00:59:02,095
where we used to live when we were young?

783
00:59:07,016 --> 00:59:08,268
Where we used to live with Mom.

784
00:59:08,351 --> 00:59:09,394
Seongjin City.

785
00:59:11,104 --> 00:59:12,105
Right.

786
00:59:16,568 --> 00:59:17,444
Should we

787
00:59:20,363 --> 00:59:21,948
go live there?

788
00:59:25,160 --> 00:59:26,202
If you don't want to--

789
00:59:26,286 --> 00:59:27,120
Sure.

790
00:59:35,962 --> 00:59:37,297
Are you really okay?

791
00:59:37,881 --> 00:59:40,758
The Chinese restaurant there
sells really good <i>jjamppong</i>.

792
00:59:40,842 --> 00:59:44,304
It's right at the entrance of the market.
It has mussels and chili pepper inside.

793
00:59:44,387 --> 00:59:45,472
The broth tastes amazing.

794
00:59:45,555 --> 00:59:46,556
Sang-tae.

795
00:59:47,432 --> 00:59:48,433
It's the best.

796
00:59:51,144 --> 00:59:53,271
You're really brave.

797
00:59:54,314 --> 00:59:55,857
I'm a coward.

798
00:59:55,940 --> 00:59:59,152
You're the younger brother.
That's why you're a coward.

799
00:59:59,694 --> 01:00:01,863
You're a coward
because you're the younger brother.

800
01:00:02,238 --> 01:00:03,281
Trust me.

801
01:00:03,364 --> 01:00:05,450
I'm the older brother,
you can count on me.

802
01:00:05,700 --> 01:00:08,036
Trust me. You can trust me.

803
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:25,011
-That's such a relief.
-Yes.

804
01:00:27,555 --> 01:00:30,850
Who is that?
Is he your boyfriend in Seoul?

805
01:00:32,227 --> 01:00:33,228
What?

806
01:00:33,394 --> 01:00:34,437

Where is Mun-yeong?

878
01:05:08,252 --> 01:05:10,630
She checked out of her hotel room.

879
01:05:12,507 --> 01:05:14,634
Oh, okay. Then I should

880
01:05:15,676 --> 01:05:17,303
also check out from my life.

881
01:05:17,386 --> 01:05:19,347
-Mom!
-Sir!

882
01:05:19,430 --> 01:05:20,556
-No!
-Catch him!

Mom!

884
01:05:22,266 --> 01:05:24,018
Sir! Stop him!

885
01:05:24,102 --> 01:05:26,020
Sir! No, sir!

Sir, stop!

887
01:05:27,522 --> 01:05:28,940
Mr. Lee!

888
01:05:32,652 --> 01:05:33,611
I think

889
01:05:35,238 --> 01:05:36,989
it's all because of me.

890
01:05:39,408 --> 01:05:40,451
What?

891
01:05:40,535 --> 01:05:41,661
To be honest,

892
01:05:42,161 --> 01:05:45,957

<i>Once you wear those shoes,</i>

916

Don't tell me...

927
01:09:32,308 --> 01:09:34,101
Yes, the ones in the rooms are fine.

928
01:09:34,185 --> 01:09:37,104
But the lights in the lobby
and the reception area are out.

929

Yes, okay.

are you here?

936
01:10:54,014 --> 01:10:55,015
Why do you think?

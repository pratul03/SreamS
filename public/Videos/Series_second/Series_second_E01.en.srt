EPISODE 1

2
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:15,575
I should be arriving in about an hour.

3
00:01:15,658 --> 00:01:17,911
Yes, I understand.

4
00:01:26,127 --> 00:01:27,504
What the hell?

5
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:32,509
Are you all right?

6
00:01:32,592 --> 00:01:34,803
I was on my phone
and wasn't watching where I was going.

7
00:01:34,886 --> 00:01:35,929
This is absurd.

8
00:01:36,721 --> 00:01:37,806
What?

9
00:01:37,889 --> 00:01:39,098
What did you just say?

10
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:41,601
Don't worry, he wasn't talking to you.

11
00:01:41,684 --> 00:01:42,560
And who are--

12
00:01:48,733 --> 00:01:50,193
You should be clearer about
who you're talking to, sir.

13
00:01:50,276 --> 00:01:52,320
-She misunderstood--
-Can you believe this ad?

14
00:01:53,029 --> 00:01:55,323
You can hardly tell
what product they're promoting.

15
00:01:55,406 --> 00:01:57,534
They've only slapped
some nameless celebrity on it.

16
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,036
You're right.
I've never seen that guy before.

17
00:02:00,120 --> 00:02:01,496
Find out who was in charge
of this ad immediately.

18
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,622
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

19
00:02:03,957 --> 00:02:04,916
Yes, sir.

20
00:02:06,501 --> 00:02:08,586
PREMIUM DUMPLINGS

21
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:12,632
DELICIOUS DUMPLINGS MADE WITH CAREFULLY
SELECTED PREMIUM INGREDIENTS

22
00:02:12,715 --> 00:02:14,217
"DO YOU WANT TO EAT WITH ME?"

23
00:02:26,354 --> 00:02:27,730
APPLE EXTRACT

24
00:02:35,071 --> 00:02:36,573
SHIN HA-RI

25
00:02:36,656 --> 00:02:40,785
Yes, Ms. Yeo. Oh, already?
Yes, I'm on my way. Okay.

26
00:02:47,667 --> 00:02:49,711
Coming through.

27
00:02:49,794 --> 00:02:51,921
-Ms. Yeo.
-What's this smell?

28
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:53,673
-Hey.
-Why are you so late?

29
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:54,966
Because of the mackerel.

30
00:02:55,049 --> 00:02:56,342
Take it easy, will you?

31
00:02:58,136 --> 00:02:59,387
You stink of fish.

32
00:02:59,470 --> 00:03:01,347
Is it that bad? I can't really tell.

33
00:03:01,431 --> 00:03:03,182
How could you not? Come here.

34
00:03:03,850 --> 00:03:07,437
It's fine. It's just proof of
how hard you're working as a researcher.

35
00:03:08,855 --> 00:03:10,023
INAUGURATION OF PRESIDENT KANG TAE-MOO

36
00:03:10,106 --> 00:03:12,817
The inauguration will start soon.
Please be seated.

37
00:03:12,901 --> 00:03:14,402
-Let's go sit.
-Okay.

38
00:03:18,948 --> 00:03:21,618
-Hello.
-This is our new hire, Hye-ji.

39
00:03:26,331 --> 00:03:30,460
Anyway, looks like the rumors are true.
President Kang's quite the workaholic.

40
00:03:30,543 --> 00:03:33,421
He's starting work
on the day he came back to Korea.

41
00:03:33,504 --> 00:03:36,132
I heard he's really hot.

42
00:03:36,215 --> 00:03:39,677
Who knows? He wasn't here when I joined
the company, so I never saw him.

43
00:03:39,761 --> 00:03:43,598
But look at the chairman.
How hot could the grandson be?

44
00:03:45,016 --> 00:03:46,684
It's been a long time coming.

45
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,687
-So the rumors aren't true.
-No.

46
00:03:49,771 --> 00:03:52,023
He's really handsome.
He looks like a celebrity.

47
00:03:52,106 --> 00:03:55,360
Please. The apple doesn’t fall far
from the tree, you know.

48
00:03:55,443 --> 00:03:58,029
President Kang will now make
his inauguration address.

49
00:03:58,529 --> 00:03:59,697
There he is.

50
00:04:10,458 --> 00:04:12,543
He's super hot!

51
00:04:12,627 --> 00:04:13,920
That's…

52
00:04:18,466 --> 00:04:19,759
-Hello, everyone.
-Why is he…

53
00:04:19,842 --> 00:04:24,430
I am Chief Secretary Cha Sung-hoon,
here on behalf of President Kang.

54
00:04:25,014 --> 00:04:26,224
What's going on?

55
00:04:26,307 --> 00:04:27,308
The chief secretary?

56
00:04:27,392 --> 00:04:30,436
I will now deliver
his inauguration address.

57
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:31,437
What is this…

58
00:04:34,232 --> 00:04:37,277
"Thank you to everyone
who arranged today's ceremony,

59
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,571
even though I clearly told you
that I didn't want one."

60
00:04:41,739 --> 00:04:44,492
"I hope going forward,
we will meet for business matters,

61
00:04:44,575 --> 00:04:46,869
not for such impractical
and ceremonial events."

62
00:04:46,953 --> 00:04:48,871
"I will properly introduce myself soon."

63
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,248
-Is that it?
-"Thank you."

64
00:04:50,331 --> 00:04:53,751
-"President Kang Tae-moo." That'll be all.
-This is amazing.

65
00:04:53,835 --> 00:04:57,755
God, these bastards! Damn it!

66
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:01,259
Oh, he's mad!

67
00:05:02,218 --> 00:05:03,177
Look!

68
00:05:05,555 --> 00:05:07,348
So where is the president?

69
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:10,560
The new president sure
seems like an interesting person.

70
00:05:14,772 --> 00:05:18,276
Why won't it just go straight? Come on!

71
00:05:20,194 --> 00:05:23,781
Come on, you're just stressed
because of the chairman's grandson.

72
00:05:23,865 --> 00:05:27,702
Yes. Everyone thought you were
going to become the new president.

73
00:05:27,785 --> 00:05:29,287
That kid snatched it away.

74
00:05:29,370 --> 00:05:31,998
We still believe in you, Mr. Park!

75
00:05:32,081 --> 00:05:34,417
I think this might help you feel better.

76
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:39,422
What's this? And what's with
that suspicious look on your face?

77
00:05:40,089 --> 00:05:41,215
Ta-da!

78
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:45,011
I tucked the rest nicely
in the trunk of your car.

79
00:05:45,094 --> 00:05:47,180
What is this?

80
00:05:47,263 --> 00:05:49,515
It's beautiful!

81
00:06:06,282 --> 00:06:07,241
It went in!

82
00:06:07,325 --> 00:06:08,868
That was amazing!

83
00:06:08,951 --> 00:06:11,829
But who the hell was that?
Where are your manners?

84
00:06:29,806 --> 00:06:31,182
It's been a while, Mr. Park.

85
00:06:31,974 --> 00:06:37,021
Look who it is? Tae-moo!
Or should I say, President Kang?

86
00:06:37,605 --> 00:06:39,524
Why are you here?
What about the inauguration?

87
00:06:39,607 --> 00:06:41,150
I heard you've been working hard.

88
00:06:41,234 --> 00:06:43,111
Taking bribes from friends, relatives,

89
00:06:43,194 --> 00:06:46,155
and even from your mistress
to sell contracts to be our partners.

90
00:06:46,239 --> 00:06:49,909
Wait a second.
I think you've been hearing rumors.

91
00:06:49,992 --> 00:06:51,536
You even hired a D-list celebrity

92
00:06:51,619 --> 00:06:54,038
for the company ad
just because he's your nephew.

93
00:06:54,122 --> 00:06:55,289
I saw it at the airport.

94
00:06:55,373 --> 00:06:57,166
No, that's…

95
00:06:59,418 --> 00:07:01,546
You must have thought it was okay
to take advantage of our company like that

96
00:07:02,213 --> 00:07:05,007
since the chairman's turned
a blind eye to what you do.

97
00:07:10,471 --> 00:07:12,807
President Kang, listen.
It's not like that.

98
00:07:12,890 --> 00:07:16,894
I've been inattentive to company matters,
spending so much time abroad.

99
00:07:16,978 --> 00:07:19,021
I intend to pay closer attention
from now on.

100
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,820
I'll see you tomorrow, then, Mr. Park.

101
00:07:28,823 --> 00:07:30,908
Hey, President Kang!

102
00:07:30,992 --> 00:07:32,702
Wait, President Kang!

103
00:07:32,785 --> 00:07:34,245
President Kang.

104
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:37,415
Mr. Park! Are you okay?

105
00:07:37,498 --> 00:07:38,791
-What is this?
-Damn it.

106
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:41,210
-What's going on?
-What is this?

107
00:07:58,394 --> 00:08:02,815
Since it's Ms. Shin's birthday, I made
reservations at Auntie's Street Food

108
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:05,401
for our team dinner today.
Ms. Shin's favorite!

109
00:08:05,485 --> 00:08:07,528
All right. How long has it been?

110
00:08:07,612 --> 00:08:10,406
Oh, you guys didn't have to do that
just for my birthday.

111
00:08:10,490 --> 00:08:11,699
Thank you.

112
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,702
What are you talking about?
A team's got to stick together.

113
00:08:14,785 --> 00:08:15,745
You're buying, right?

114
00:08:16,954 --> 00:08:17,914
Great!

115
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:20,708
<i>Happy birthday. Can you swing by?
I have something for you.</i>

116
00:08:23,461 --> 00:08:27,965
Ms. Yeo, I'm sorry, but I don't think
I can make it to the team dinner today.

117
00:08:28,049 --> 00:08:29,800
Why? What is it?

118
00:08:30,635 --> 00:08:31,969
Is it a guy?

119
00:08:32,595 --> 00:08:33,554
How did you know?

120
00:08:33,638 --> 00:08:38,726
Because your soulless eyes
are suddenly sparkling. That's how.

121
00:08:39,268 --> 00:08:40,978
Okay, go on.

122
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:46,025
It looks like we'll have to celebrate
Ms. Shin's birthday

123
00:08:46,108 --> 00:08:47,610
without the birthday girl.

124
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:50,446
An inauguration without the president,

125
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,907
and a birthday party
without the birthday girl?

126
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:54,075
What's going on?

127
00:08:54,158 --> 00:08:57,495
Seriously. This is like celebrating
Thanksgiving without a turkey.

128
00:08:58,329 --> 00:09:00,873
I'm sorry.
I promise the next dinner is on me!

129
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,416
I'm sorry.

130
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:16,222
Hello?

131
00:09:16,305 --> 00:09:17,515
Ha-ri!

132
00:09:17,598 --> 00:09:20,893
I'm so busy, I can't even meet up
with you on your birthday.

133
00:09:20,977 --> 00:09:22,478
So what's my girl got planned?

134
00:09:22,562 --> 00:09:24,981
Min-woo wants to see me,
so I'm heading over.

135
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:26,440
One moment.

136
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,984
Min-woo?

137
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,860
Why is he calling you on your birthday?

138
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,321
After he made you
do all that work for his new menu?

139
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:35,908
That was hardly work.
I had a blast, and I learned a lot too.

140
00:09:35,992 --> 00:09:39,787
<i>Goodness, you're really head-over-heels
for Min-woo.</i>

141
00:09:39,870 --> 00:09:42,873
But he's never been the type
to remember birthdays. Why is he--

142
00:09:44,250 --> 00:09:46,210
Wait, no way!

143
00:09:46,294 --> 00:09:47,211
No way, what?

144
00:09:47,295 --> 00:09:49,589
Was that necklace from before
really your birthday gift?

145
00:09:49,672 --> 00:09:50,715
Necklace?

146
00:10:01,809 --> 00:10:03,227
Why is a woman's necklace here?

147
00:10:03,811 --> 00:10:05,938
Maybe some customer left it behind.

148
00:10:06,814 --> 00:10:09,483
There's even a certificate
of authenticity!

149
00:10:10,693 --> 00:10:12,653
Look, this is garnet!

150
00:10:12,737 --> 00:10:13,904
That's my birthstone.

151
00:10:13,988 --> 00:10:15,740
Is he dating a girl born in January?

152
00:10:15,823 --> 00:10:17,992
Remember that foreign model girl?

153
00:10:18,075 --> 00:10:20,661
She went back to her country
after Min-woo rejected her.

154
00:10:20,745 --> 00:10:23,831
Then is it that journalist
writing an article on his restaurant?

155
00:10:23,914 --> 00:10:27,001
She was flirting with Min-woo
but stopped after he friendzoned her.

156
00:10:27,084 --> 00:10:28,085
The YouTuber then!

157
00:10:28,169 --> 00:10:30,504
That YouTuber?
She asked him out on a livestream.

158
00:10:30,588 --> 00:10:32,840
And got rejected live. Right.

159
00:10:33,799 --> 00:10:36,344
Maybe it's your birthday present.

160
00:10:36,427 --> 00:10:38,137
You think? Let me see.

161
00:10:38,763 --> 00:10:42,099
No, this is way too expensive
to buy for a friend.

162
00:10:42,183 --> 00:10:43,809
-Right?
-Yeah.

163
00:10:57,782 --> 00:10:59,033
<i>It has to be!</i>

164
00:10:59,116 --> 00:11:01,410
That necklace really was for you!

165
00:11:01,494 --> 00:11:04,163
You said that it was too expensive
to buy for a friend.

166
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:06,624
Well, what if he's planning to transfer

167
00:11:06,707 --> 00:11:09,085
from the friendship train
to the boyfriend express?

168
00:11:09,168 --> 00:11:12,713
<i>If you are transferring to Train 6,
please exit at the next stop.</i>

169
00:11:12,797 --> 00:11:15,007
<i>The exit is to the right.</i>

170
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:31,565
-Has the inauguration been taken care of?
-Yes, it went well.

171
00:11:33,567 --> 00:11:34,902
What about the chairman?

172
00:11:40,491 --> 00:11:42,576
You crazy bastard.

173
00:11:42,660 --> 00:11:45,246
I told you to come to the inauguration.
You blow me off.

174
00:11:45,329 --> 00:11:48,165
I told you to meet me at the house,
but you meet me at work.

175
00:11:48,249 --> 00:11:50,459
You're determined to go against me,
aren't you?

176
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,003
Of course not. I've simply been too busy.

177
00:11:53,087 --> 00:11:56,424
You just flew back in today!
You can't take a single damn day off?

178
00:11:56,507 --> 00:11:59,885
No, I can't. There are too many things
that need to be taken care of.

179
00:11:59,969 --> 00:12:01,554
What now?

180
00:12:02,179 --> 00:12:05,808
Why the hell does Park keep on calling me?

181
00:12:05,891 --> 00:12:07,768
What things need to be taken care of?

182
00:12:07,852 --> 00:12:10,813
This is a well-oiled machine.
You're nitpicking.

183
00:12:10,896 --> 00:12:13,649
You think you're
the only smart one in the world.

184
00:12:13,732 --> 00:12:15,526
Are you realizing that now?

185
00:12:16,235 --> 00:12:18,946
You know none of
my projects has failed, right?

186
00:12:19,029 --> 00:12:21,073
Even the kimchi project
was a hit overseas.

187
00:12:21,157 --> 00:12:23,993
Yes, I'm aware. That's actually why

188
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:28,831
I've prepared a very important
project for you.

189
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:31,417
What kind of project?

190
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,095
Marriage!

191
00:12:43,179 --> 00:12:45,473
Are you getting married, sir?

192
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:47,391
Not me!

193
00:12:47,475 --> 00:12:50,519
No, thank you.
I'm too young to get married.

194
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,230
But I'm not getting any younger, you know.

195
00:12:53,314 --> 00:12:57,860
Is it too much to ask to see
my grandson with a wife?

196
00:12:57,943 --> 00:13:00,362
Yes, it's too much. I'm not seeing anyone,

197
00:13:00,446 --> 00:13:02,573
and I don't plan to anytime soon.

198
00:13:02,656 --> 00:13:04,492
Besides, I have a lot of work to do.

199
00:13:04,575 --> 00:13:09,788
That's why I've arranged
all the blind dates for you.

200
00:13:09,872 --> 00:13:11,916
-What?
-I've put together a list

201
00:13:11,999 --> 00:13:17,546
of 20 elite, single ladies
in the business world for you to meet.

202
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,757
All you have to do is show up.

203
00:13:19,840 --> 00:13:20,799
Okay?

204
00:13:20,883 --> 00:13:22,176
You made the list yourself?

205
00:13:22,259 --> 00:13:23,928
Wow, that couldn't have been easy.

206
00:13:24,011 --> 00:13:25,721
That's right, it wasn't easy.

207
00:13:25,804 --> 00:13:27,348
If I had anyone else do it,

208
00:13:27,431 --> 00:13:30,684
the entire finance sector
would be buzzing with rumors.

209
00:13:30,768 --> 00:13:33,062
-So--
-You've wasted your time.

210
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,731
I won't ever go
on any of your arranged dates.

211
00:13:35,814 --> 00:13:38,817
You little brat.
What am I going to do with you?

212
00:13:41,445 --> 00:13:42,655
What is it?

213
00:13:44,615 --> 00:13:45,908
ALARM 9:00 P.M.
TIME TO WATCH DRAMA

214
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:48,494
It's time already, huh?

215
00:13:49,954 --> 00:13:52,081
It's already time.

<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

217
00:13:53,874 --> 00:13:55,584

00:14:01,340 --> 00:14:02,758
Let's see.

222
00:14:02,841 --> 00:14:04,843
If you're just going to watch TV, go home.

223
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:08,931
Do you think I'm going to listen to you
when you don't listen to me?

224
00:14:09,765 --> 00:14:11,058
I'll watch it here.

225
00:14:18,274 --> 00:14:20,818
<i>It's been quite a while
since he broke up with Yu-ra.</i>

226
00:14:20,901 --> 00:14:24,864
<i>Maybe he's finally noticed that you've had
a crush on him and is ready to accept?</i>

227
00:14:24,947 --> 00:14:26,782
No way.

228
00:14:28,284 --> 00:14:30,703
What? Why is it so dark?

229
00:14:36,458 --> 00:14:37,918
Is Min-woo really--

230
00:14:40,004 --> 00:14:43,507
Attention, please.
Min-woo is about to transfer

231
00:14:43,591 --> 00:14:47,011
from the friendship train
to the boyfriend express.

232
00:14:53,684 --> 00:14:57,605
What are you waiting for?
Run to him and give him a hug already!

233
00:14:58,647 --> 00:15:00,774
Run!

234
00:15:07,406 --> 00:15:10,242
Min-woo.

235
00:15:15,205 --> 00:15:17,750
GYU-SIK LOVES BO-HUI
HAPPY 100TH DAY

236
00:15:31,013 --> 00:15:32,765
What's her problem?

237
00:15:34,391 --> 00:15:35,976
This is so annoying.

238
00:15:41,732 --> 00:15:44,151
Yikes, I really messed that up for you,
didn't I?

239
00:15:44,234 --> 00:15:46,654
It's okay.
I was doing it since they're regulars.

240
00:15:46,737 --> 00:15:48,489
I just gave them the food for free.

241
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:57,331
Anyway, sorry. You must be busy.
I'll get going.

242
00:15:57,998 --> 00:15:59,083
Wait a second.

243
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,631
Happy birthday, Ha-ri.

244
00:16:13,180 --> 00:16:19,436
<i>BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

<i>Happy birthday, Ha-ri.</i>

247
00:16:23,857 --> 00:16:25,609
Tickets to your favorite singer's concert.

248
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:29,279
They weren't easy to get, so make sure you
go with a guy and not with Young-seo.

249
00:16:30,114 --> 00:16:31,115
Okay.

250
00:16:31,949 --> 00:16:33,117
Go on.

251
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,417
You have no clue what I really like.

252
00:16:45,045 --> 00:16:46,672
Good going.

253
00:16:46,755 --> 00:16:51,552
You're eating instant food
as your first meal back in Korea

254
00:16:51,635 --> 00:16:55,389
when you know how to cook everything
from Korean to Western!

255
00:16:55,472 --> 00:17:00,352
Wouldn't it be nice
to sit at the dinner table with your wife

256
00:17:00,436 --> 00:17:02,563
and enjoy a good home-cooked meal?

257
00:17:02,646 --> 00:17:04,732
I'm not getting married just for that.

258
00:17:04,815 --> 00:17:08,485
I hear American women are beautiful.

259
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:12,156
Did you really not date at all?
I'm open-minded, you know.

260
00:17:12,239 --> 00:17:15,034
I have no time for that.
I'm busy enough with work.

261
00:17:15,117 --> 00:17:19,204
That's why I've scheduled
your blind dates for you. So--

262
00:17:19,288 --> 00:17:21,373
I told you I'm not interested, didn't I?

263
00:17:26,045 --> 00:17:29,173
Are you two dating?

264
00:17:29,923 --> 00:17:30,758
-What?
-What?

265
00:17:30,841 --> 00:17:32,051
It seems that way.

266
00:17:32,134 --> 00:17:34,845
You two are joined at the hip,
using work as an excuse.

267
00:17:34,928 --> 00:17:36,722
I don't know about him, but I'm not gay.

268
00:17:36,805 --> 00:17:38,974
And even if I liked men,

269
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:43,937
-President Kang isn't really my style.
-Is that so? Not your style?

270
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:46,690
Hey, what do you mean?
What's wrong with me?

271
00:17:46,774 --> 00:17:49,068
Fine. If you're not, you're not.

272
00:17:49,777 --> 00:17:52,446
Then why are you
so against going on these dates?

273
00:17:56,700 --> 00:17:57,868
What is it now?

274
00:17:58,535 --> 00:17:59,870
ALARM 10 P.M.

Ah, shoot…

276
00:18:01,246 --> 00:18:03,832
I can take care of myself,
so just go watch your TV shows.

277
00:18:03,916 --> 00:18:05,292
Isn't that alarm for them?

278
00:18:05,375 --> 00:18:07,669
It's for my blood pressure medication!

279
00:18:07,753 --> 00:18:10,297
My blood pressure is so high nowadays
because of you.

280
00:18:10,380 --> 00:18:12,508
I'm taking pills every day!

281
00:18:12,591 --> 00:18:14,968
How is that my fault?
It runs in the family.

282
00:18:15,052 --> 00:18:17,513
It'd be your fault
if I got high blood pressure.

283
00:18:17,596 --> 00:18:18,639

00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,685

Hey, everyone, help yourselves.

289
00:18:35,322 --> 00:18:36,240
Eat up, guys.

290
00:18:36,323 --> 00:18:37,282
Okay.

291
00:18:37,366 --> 00:18:39,159
-Cheers!
-Bottoms up!

292
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:40,786
Cheers!

293
00:18:52,464 --> 00:18:55,551
-Sir, can I get some more of these chips?
-Go ahead.

294
00:18:55,634 --> 00:18:57,678
-Mom!
-Gosh, what? You scared me!

295
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:01,849
I told you that you have to coat
the chicken properly to make it crispy.

296
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,434
I told you you have to be thorough.

297
00:19:04,518 --> 00:19:06,228
But I am tossing it!

298
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:10,607
If we're not going to do things right,
we should just close up shop.

299
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:14,611
I guess that's why
the chicken Ha-ri makes tastes better.

300
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:15,529
You're the best!

301
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:20,742
Of course! She works at a major company,
after all. She's different.

302
00:19:20,826 --> 00:19:23,537
Why are you so edgy today?

303
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:27,332
It can't feel great to have to work
on your birthday, of all days.

304
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:30,544
So what? I'm the one
who gave birth after 20 hours of labor!

305
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:35,382

306
00:19:38,635 --> 00:19:39,803
Will he be all right?

307
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:43,348
Yes. His blood pressure's higher
than usual, but it's not serious.

308
00:19:43,432 --> 00:19:45,267
What do you mean, it's not serious?

309
00:19:45,350 --> 00:19:47,811
Last time, you said that my lungs,

310
00:19:47,895 --> 00:19:50,772
kidneys, and small intestine
weren't doing great.

311
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:51,857
What? I did?

312
00:19:51,940 --> 00:19:53,859
Doctor!

313
00:19:54,401 --> 00:19:56,945
Oh, yes, that's right. I remember now.

314
00:19:57,487 --> 00:20:00,699
Considering his age,
things can change drastically day by day.

315
00:20:00,782 --> 00:20:03,911
And you said I should avoid stress
more than anything, right?

316
00:20:03,994 --> 00:20:04,828
Yes, sir.

317
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:08,040
-Everyone around him should be careful.
-Did you hear that?

318
00:20:08,123 --> 00:20:11,376
It seems you're fine,
so drop the act and get out of bed.

319
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:15,547
You! Do you really want
to see me die because of you?

320
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:16,924
I'm going to--

321
00:20:17,007 --> 00:20:20,010
Since you're already here,
why don't you get a full checkup?

322
00:20:20,093 --> 00:20:21,345
I'm leaving.

00:20:25,974 --> 00:20:30,062
SEOUL KANGSUNG HOSPITAL

324
00:20:47,120 --> 00:20:49,039
What's the point of group reservations?

325
00:20:49,623 --> 00:20:51,208
You give them a discount,

326
00:20:51,291 --> 00:20:53,293
and they just fill up on the free snacks.

327
00:20:56,296 --> 00:20:59,466
Why has she been so grumpy all day?

328
00:21:00,509 --> 00:21:01,802
Hey, Ha-ri.

329
00:21:01,885 --> 00:21:05,555
Don't you have a boyfriend who can throw
you a birthday party or something?

330
00:21:06,139 --> 00:21:08,016
I didn't leave anything in front of

331
00:21:08,100 --> 00:21:09,601
-your store!
-What's going on?

332
00:21:09,685 --> 00:21:11,561
I told you I saw it! This is yours!

333
00:21:11,645 --> 00:21:13,563
You've got a big mouth for a kid!

334
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:14,606
-Yes, I do!
-What?

335
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:16,316
-Hey.
-What? What is it?

336
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:18,193
Why is this in front of our store?

337
00:21:18,277 --> 00:21:19,695
I put it there for a minute

338
00:21:19,778 --> 00:21:22,072
because a customer parked
in front of our store!

339
00:21:22,155 --> 00:21:24,783
I know you put it here
whenever you get the chance.

340
00:21:24,866 --> 00:21:26,076
Did you see me do it?

341
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,578
It's obvious!
We find fish bones all the time!

342
00:21:28,662 --> 00:21:30,622
We don't sell fish! We sell chicken.

343
00:21:30,706 --> 00:21:32,708
-Take it.
-We don't sell fish either.

344
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:35,711
It says it right there.
"Fish, dried fish, mackerel, so on."

345
00:21:35,794 --> 00:21:36,753
-Take it.
-Honey, come on.

346
00:21:36,837 --> 00:21:40,132
We're all neighbors here. There's no need
to fight. Let's talk it out.

347
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:43,302
-I'm doing this so we don't have to fight.
-Come on, take it!

348
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:46,471
This is a new shirt!
I had it shipped from abroad!

349
00:21:46,555 --> 00:21:50,267
-You toss it! Do what you want with it!
-Hey, don't shove it at him!

350
00:21:51,018 --> 00:21:52,311
I didn't…

351
00:21:55,564 --> 00:21:57,482
You were the one who started it!

352
00:21:58,734 --> 00:21:59,568
Get in here.

353
00:22:02,821 --> 00:22:06,658
Man, breaking the neighbor's store sign
and everything…

354
00:22:06,742 --> 00:22:08,452
I feel so bad.

355
00:22:09,036 --> 00:22:11,705
Everyone in the Shin family
has such a temper!

356
00:22:12,289 --> 00:22:15,792
As if it wasn't enough that Ha-min
started fighting, why did you do that?

357
00:22:15,876 --> 00:22:18,086
I got this temper from you, Mom.

358
00:22:18,795 --> 00:22:21,173
Yes, why are you blaming it on the Shins?

359
00:22:21,256 --> 00:22:23,842
What? Since when did you two
get along so well?

360
00:22:23,925 --> 00:22:26,887
You guys just have to
talk back like that, don't you?

361
00:22:26,970 --> 00:22:29,514
It's because I take after you, Mom!

362
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:31,391
It's my birthday!

363
00:22:32,392 --> 00:22:33,435
Why are you hitting me?

364
00:22:35,145 --> 00:22:37,272
You can't keep on using that as an excuse!

365
00:22:40,067 --> 00:22:42,861
I made you seaweed soup in the morning!
Isn't that enough?

366
00:22:44,654 --> 00:22:47,449
You forgot to cook her seaweed soup today.

367
00:22:48,450 --> 00:22:49,951
Just stop it.

368
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:02,756
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, HA-RI
FROM MIN-WOO

369
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:08,970
<i>Happy birthday, Ha-ri.</i>

370
00:23:09,471 --> 00:23:11,723
<i>Tickets to your favorite singer's concert.</i>

371
00:23:11,807 --> 00:23:15,393
<i>They weren't easy to get, so make sure you
go with a guy and not with Young-seo.</i>

372
00:23:37,833 --> 00:23:40,210
Fine. I said, fine.

373
00:23:41,837 --> 00:23:44,131
Did you have a good night's sleep?

374
00:23:53,390 --> 00:23:58,270
-I have something to tell you.
-I just got a call from Mr. Park.

375
00:23:58,353 --> 00:24:01,148
So you're aware of the situation?
I'm going to fire Mr. Park.

376
00:24:01,231 --> 00:24:03,066
What? Says who?

377
00:24:03,150 --> 00:24:06,319
He selected the subcontractors illegally.

378
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:11,741
But he still did a lot for the company
working under your predecessor.

379
00:24:11,825 --> 00:24:13,869
He built a summer house
on our company land.

380
00:24:13,952 --> 00:24:17,038
And he used our employees
for his personal affairs.

381
00:24:17,122 --> 00:24:19,583
He'll do it all over again
if we let him be.

382
00:24:25,088 --> 00:24:26,464
Park's father is Sang-gu,

383
00:24:26,548 --> 00:24:31,720
my good old friend who contributed
greatly to our company's success.

384
00:24:31,803 --> 00:24:34,764
He asked me to take care
of his son for him when he passed--

385
00:24:34,848 --> 00:24:37,893
You can take care of him personally
after letting him go.

386
00:24:37,976 --> 00:24:39,186
Come on.

387
00:24:40,437 --> 00:24:41,897
Then,

388
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,524
do me a favor in return.

389
00:24:46,109 --> 00:24:47,027
Go on the dates!

390
00:24:49,070 --> 00:24:52,157
-Grandfather, that's--
-Stop making excuses and just do it.

391
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:55,202
I'm breaking the promise
I made to my dead friend.

392
00:24:55,285 --> 00:24:58,038
It's the least you could do.

393
00:25:04,127 --> 00:25:06,546
Fine, I'll go on the dates.

394
00:25:06,630 --> 00:25:09,424
You mean it? Really?

395
00:25:09,507 --> 00:25:11,301
Ms. Ahn, you heard it too, right?

396
00:25:11,384 --> 00:25:13,470
-Yes, sir.
-You're my witness, okay?

397
00:25:13,553 --> 00:25:14,679
All right.

398
00:25:15,263 --> 00:25:18,058
Ha-ri, why did you have to go
and lose your temper?

399
00:25:18,141 --> 00:25:20,810
Wait, the total is 800,000 won…

400
00:25:20,894 --> 00:25:25,523
My tiny monthly pay minus
money for my savings, work loan,

401
00:25:25,607 --> 00:25:28,735
and spending money…
I barely have anything left.

402
00:25:28,818 --> 00:25:32,864
Where am I going to get 800,000 won?

403
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,411
-Did you hear?
-Oh, my God!

404
00:25:39,204 --> 00:25:41,331
You don't know?
I'm the only one who's heard?

405
00:25:41,414 --> 00:25:43,250
Don't freak out, okay?

406
00:25:43,333 --> 00:25:45,502
Mr. Park got fired.

407
00:25:45,585 --> 00:25:47,587
-What?
-Are you sure you heard right?

408
00:25:47,671 --> 00:25:50,215
He's one of the chairman's men,
but he got fired?

409
00:25:50,298 --> 00:25:51,549
Why did they fire him?

410
00:25:51,633 --> 00:25:54,761
Apparently, he's been accepting bribes
from the subcontractors.

411
00:25:54,844 --> 00:25:58,598
I heard President Kang is really strict.
So it's true.

412
00:25:58,682 --> 00:26:00,183
I know, right?

413
00:26:01,268 --> 00:26:02,894
You guys don't seem shocked, though.

414
00:26:08,275 --> 00:26:09,401
Hi, Young-seo.

415
00:26:10,986 --> 00:26:16,366
So you got ahead of yourself and ended up
completely ruining somebody's event.

416
00:26:16,449 --> 00:26:19,411
Hey, you're partially responsible.
You put ideas into my head.

417
00:26:19,494 --> 00:26:20,495
INCOMING CALL
BIOLOGICAL FATHER

418
00:26:20,578 --> 00:26:24,499
"Biological father"?
Did you fight with your dad again?

419
00:26:24,582 --> 00:26:26,584
When were we ever on good terms?

420
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:28,295
Why is he calling me at this hour?

421
00:26:34,384 --> 00:26:38,263
How could he tell me
about a blind date on the day of?

422
00:26:38,346 --> 00:26:39,180
MANNA SNACK BAR

423
00:26:39,264 --> 00:26:41,433
But I thought blind dates
were off the table

424
00:26:41,516 --> 00:26:43,935
after you faked that exorcism
on your last one.

425
00:26:44,019 --> 00:26:45,520
You're still getting offers?

426
00:26:45,603 --> 00:26:49,232
I suppose the rumors didn't spread
as much as I had thought.

427
00:26:50,358 --> 00:26:51,651
Damn it!

428
00:26:54,321 --> 00:26:55,572
Wait for me.

429
00:26:55,655 --> 00:26:58,033
So, who is it this time?
Is it the Dongseong Group?

430
00:26:58,616 --> 00:26:59,784
Daemin Group?

431
00:26:59,868 --> 00:27:02,370
I don't know. I didn't even ask.

432
00:27:02,912 --> 00:27:05,457
I'm so busy with work already.

433
00:27:06,666 --> 00:27:09,419
Rather than getting wrinkles
from working overtime,

434
00:27:10,170 --> 00:27:13,465
isn't going on a blind date
with a wealthy guy more productive?

435
00:27:13,548 --> 00:27:18,219
No, I'm never doing an arranged marriage.

436
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:22,140
I'm only going to marry out of love
with someone I meet through fate.

437
00:27:23,183 --> 00:27:25,769
You're so spoiled,
talking about fate and all that.

438
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,313
So I was thinking.

439
00:27:28,897 --> 00:27:30,982
I'm going to need your help again.

440
00:27:31,858 --> 00:27:34,944
Hey, I told you I'd stop doing that
once I got a job.

441
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,237
I'll pass.

442
00:27:38,031 --> 00:27:39,866
This is the last time, I swear!

443
00:27:39,949 --> 00:27:43,328
Can't you just pretend
to be possessed just one more time

444
00:27:43,411 --> 00:27:45,830
so I can stop going on
these blind dates for good?

445
00:27:53,463 --> 00:27:56,216
You must be nervous.
You haven't said a word.

446
00:27:58,259 --> 00:28:00,762
-What's wrong, Young-seo?
-No.

447
00:28:00,845 --> 00:28:03,556
-No.
-Young-seo, are you all right?

448
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:04,808
Let go!

449
00:28:07,894 --> 00:28:10,271
Do you have any idea
who you're addressing?

450
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:15,110
How dare you approach the noble host

451
00:28:15,693 --> 00:28:18,279
of the spirit of the great general,
you filthy mortal?

452
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:19,864
Spirit of the great general?

453
00:28:20,448 --> 00:28:22,283
What's that?

454
00:28:24,411 --> 00:28:26,162
What the hell are you doing?

455
00:28:26,246 --> 00:28:27,914
-What's gotten into you?
-Stay still.

456
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:30,208
If you value your life, stay still.

457
00:28:31,459 --> 00:28:36,965
What have you done to make such a vengeful
maiden spirit attach herself to you?

458
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,684
Am I the only one who can see the ghost--

459
00:28:49,185 --> 00:28:52,355
<i>I looked up the heir of Daepoong Group,
and he was a huge playboy.</i>

460
00:28:52,439 --> 00:28:56,651
<i>So I tossed in the maiden spirit part.
He was so terrified.</i>

461
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,448
That's what I'm talking about.

462
00:29:01,948 --> 00:29:04,075
Can you help me out again? Please?

463
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:05,744
No, do it yourself.

464
00:29:06,327 --> 00:29:10,039
Come on,
my acting will only get me so far.

465
00:29:10,540 --> 00:29:12,125
Help me.

466
00:29:13,376 --> 00:29:16,588
No. I'm uncomfortable
with so many people knowing my face.

467
00:29:17,505 --> 00:29:18,923
I'll pay you.

468
00:29:22,218 --> 00:29:23,720
What? Tonight at seven?

469
00:29:23,803 --> 00:29:26,306
Yes, sir. At the coffee shop
at the Imperial Hotel.

470
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:28,266
With Jin Young-seo from the Marine Group.

471
00:29:28,349 --> 00:29:31,352
I have a full schedule today.
Tell them I'm busy.

472
00:29:33,021 --> 00:29:37,108
<i>I don't want to hear you say anything
about being too busy.</i>

473
00:29:37,192 --> 00:29:40,236
<i>Sung-hoon, move some things around
and make the time.</i>

474
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:43,198
<i>This is exactly why I pay you so much.</i>

475
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,785
And that's why I went ahead
and cleared your schedule.

476
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:48,912
It was easier at the overseas branch.

477
00:29:48,995 --> 00:29:52,707
I hope you find a suitable partner
among the top ten candidates.

478
00:29:53,291 --> 00:29:54,209
Why is that?

479
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:56,669
Number 11 is in Japan
and 17 is in Switzerland.

480
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,922
Do you want to travel
that far for a blind date?

481
00:29:59,005 --> 00:30:00,089
What?

482
00:30:00,173 --> 00:30:02,675
Or just get married
like the chairman wants.

483
00:30:02,759 --> 00:30:05,595
Then I won't have to bother
with making time in your schedule

484
00:30:05,678 --> 00:30:08,139
and you won't
have to waste any more time--

485
00:30:08,223 --> 00:30:10,558
I'm just frustrated, that's all.

486
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:14,270
I mean, I get where
the chairman is coming from.

487
00:30:14,354 --> 00:30:15,605
No.

488
00:30:16,439 --> 00:30:18,066
I think it's a good idea.

489
00:30:20,485 --> 00:30:21,778
Marriage.

490
00:30:30,662 --> 00:30:32,372
Hello.

491
00:30:33,289 --> 00:30:34,958
We're going for a tough girl concept

492
00:30:35,041 --> 00:30:37,335
for Marine Beauty's new product line.

493
00:30:37,418 --> 00:30:39,963
Let's pick the clothes you'll wear
to the blind date here.

494
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,468
Okay.

495
00:30:45,552 --> 00:30:48,096
Something lacey like this
will look super intimidating.

496
00:30:51,683 --> 00:30:54,936
Or a leather belt like this
to make a bold statement.

497
00:30:55,520 --> 00:30:57,605
That looks tough! Let's go with this.

498
00:31:02,193 --> 00:31:05,530
-Maybe I should be showing more skin?
-Yeah. Let's try on something else.

499
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:08,575
-No.
-No.

500
00:31:08,658 --> 00:31:09,742
This?

501
00:31:09,826 --> 00:31:11,452
Hey, you're doing this on purpose!

502
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,038
-That one's really not it.
-I'm cold.

503
00:31:14,122 --> 00:31:17,083
That's the point.
It makes you look like you're crazy.

504
00:31:17,166 --> 00:31:20,295
-I will not…
-Marry you!

505
00:31:20,795 --> 00:31:22,380
You're like a cute little fox.

506
00:31:39,772 --> 00:31:42,108
Bravo! Perfect.

507
00:31:42,817 --> 00:31:44,193
You're so pretty.

508
00:31:53,244 --> 00:31:57,373
<i>The play has started, and now it's time
to flex your acting chops, Ha-ri.</i>

509
00:31:58,499 --> 00:31:59,459
<i>No, wait.</i>

510
00:31:59,959 --> 00:32:02,128
<i>I'm Young-seo now.</i>

511
00:32:02,712 --> 00:32:05,298
<i>Jin Young-seo.</i>

512
00:32:07,467 --> 00:32:08,301
Ms. Jin Young-seo?

513
00:32:08,384 --> 00:32:09,469
Yes.

514
00:32:14,349 --> 00:32:16,809
<i>What? Why is he so good-looking?</i>

515
00:32:17,435 --> 00:32:18,311
<i>He's hot.</i>

516
00:32:18,394 --> 00:32:19,604
You are Ms. Jin, right?

517
00:32:20,188 --> 00:32:21,230
Yes.

518
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:24,067
Please have a seat.

519
00:32:41,042 --> 00:32:44,253
<i>I wish I could take my time
appreciating his looks.</i>

520
00:32:44,337 --> 00:32:47,256
<i>But I need to end things quickly. Right.</i>

521
00:32:48,007 --> 00:32:49,968
<i>Why don't I start by being rude?</i>

522
00:32:53,012 --> 00:32:55,306
I don't even know who you are.

523
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,265
Your name is?

524
00:33:00,395 --> 00:33:02,063
My name is Kang Tae-moo.

525
00:33:02,146 --> 00:33:03,564
What? Kang, what?

526
00:33:03,648 --> 00:33:04,524
Kang Tae-moo.

527
00:33:04,607 --> 00:33:05,900
"Kang Tae-moo"?

528
00:33:06,567 --> 00:33:07,819
Oops.

529
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:12,448
Kang Tae-moo.

530
00:33:14,659 --> 00:33:16,077
<i>Kang Tae-moo?</i>

531
00:33:16,869 --> 00:33:19,122
<i>The president of our company,
Kang Tae-moo?</i>

532
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,004
Ms. Jin?

533
00:33:27,547 --> 00:33:28,840
-Ms. Jin!
-Yes?

534
00:33:29,966 --> 00:33:31,050
Is something wrong?

535
00:33:31,884 --> 00:33:34,637
No. Not at all.

536
00:33:35,972 --> 00:33:37,849
I need to pop to the bathroom.

537
00:33:42,270 --> 00:33:44,981
Excuse me, where's the bathroom?
Over there? Okay.

538
00:33:45,064 --> 00:33:48,026
Young-seo, please pick up, please!

539
00:33:48,109 --> 00:33:50,236
<i>Please leave your message after the tone.</i>

540
00:33:50,319 --> 00:33:51,904
Young-seo, you crazy wench!

541
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,867
This is ridiculous.

542
00:33:57,493 --> 00:33:58,536
Right!

543
00:33:59,287 --> 00:34:01,581
Let's run! I can just run away.

544
00:34:10,131 --> 00:34:13,760
<i>I just need to stay calm
and do what needs to be done.</i>

545
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:16,888
<i>There's 800,000 won on the line!
You can do this, Ha--</i>

546
00:34:16,971 --> 00:34:18,765
<i>I mean, Young-seo.</i>

547
00:34:19,640 --> 00:34:20,600
Please.

548
00:34:21,934 --> 00:34:23,019
Sure.

549
00:34:26,147 --> 00:34:27,899
<i>Don't be so nervous.</i>

550
00:34:27,982 --> 00:34:31,527
<i>This guy doesn't know I'm Ha-ri,
an employee at his company.</i>

551
00:34:31,611 --> 00:34:33,821
<i>He thinks I'm Young-seo from Marine Group.</i>

552
00:34:38,117 --> 00:34:40,036
It's so hot.

553
00:34:40,787 --> 00:34:42,622
It's a bit hot in here, isn't it?

554
00:34:48,836 --> 00:34:51,464
<i>No man likes a woman
who reveals too much skin.</i>

555
00:34:51,547 --> 00:34:52,423
Aren't you cold?

556
00:34:52,507 --> 00:34:54,926
Cold? No, this is perfect.

557
00:34:55,510 --> 00:34:59,055
My body runs a bit hot, you see.

558
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:03,851
You have goosebumps all over your arm.

559
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,186
<i>Crap.</i>

560
00:35:06,896 --> 00:35:09,315
I just get goosebumps a lot, you know.

561
00:35:09,398 --> 00:35:10,942
<i>On to the next step.</i>

562
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:13,111
Oh, sorry!

563
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:18,366
Baby, did I scare you?
You took a little bump? It's okay!

564
00:35:18,449 --> 00:35:21,410
Did you get startled too? My babies!

565
00:35:22,328 --> 00:35:26,040
<i>A woman crazy about luxury goods.
How's that for a turn-off--</i>

566
00:35:27,166 --> 00:35:28,417
What are you doing?

567
00:35:30,169 --> 00:35:32,713
Sorry, it was a text from work.

568
00:35:32,797 --> 00:35:34,090
You were saying?

569
00:35:34,173 --> 00:35:36,300
<i>This won't do. On to my last resort.</i>

570
00:35:36,384 --> 00:35:39,053
-I'm so sad.
-What?

571
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:42,974
I'm sad. You being so uninterested in me

572
00:35:43,057 --> 00:35:46,060
makes Samantha and Rachel really sad.

573
00:35:46,644 --> 00:35:48,354
Samantha and Rachel?

574
00:35:48,437 --> 00:35:49,647
Yes.

575
00:35:55,695 --> 00:35:58,906
The one on the left is Samantha,
and the one on the right is Rachel.

576
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:02,285
I spent a whopping ten million won a piece
on these babies.

577
00:36:03,286 --> 00:36:04,120
Hi!

578
00:36:04,203 --> 00:36:06,581
<i>I bet you've never met anyone
as crazy as this before.</i>

579
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:11,836
I'm rambling, aren't I?

580
00:36:12,670 --> 00:36:14,255
Oh, my.

581
00:36:15,715 --> 00:36:16,549
No.

582
00:36:17,466 --> 00:36:21,262
I prefer an honest person like you
over a hypocrite who lies.

583
00:36:21,846 --> 00:36:22,763
-<i>What?</i>
-What?

584
00:36:22,847 --> 00:36:24,182
<i>Why is he so positive?</i>

585
00:36:24,724 --> 00:36:29,729
<i>This won't work.
I need to bring out the big guns.</i>

586
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,654
Really? You really like me?

587
00:36:38,738 --> 00:36:40,114
Oh, my.

588
00:36:40,198 --> 00:36:41,407
Then should we…

589
00:36:43,367 --> 00:36:44,410
get a room?

590
00:36:55,171 --> 00:36:56,047
A room?

591
00:36:56,714 --> 00:37:01,510
Yes, so that we can really
get down to business.

592
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:05,556
<i>How's that?</i>

593
00:37:05,640 --> 00:37:09,393
<i>There's no way that you'll like a woman
who wants to get a room on the first date.</i>

594
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,521
<i>No way…</i>

595
00:37:21,948 --> 00:37:23,199
Let's go.

596
00:37:23,282 --> 00:37:24,283
Okay.

597
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:26,452
Okay.

598
00:37:37,713 --> 00:37:38,673
<i>What is this?</i>

599
00:37:39,507 --> 00:37:41,676
<i>What'll happen
if I just follow him into that room?</i>

600
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:48,808
<i>Let's run! The money's not worth it!</i>

601
00:37:51,018 --> 00:37:52,728
Oh! I'm sorry.

602
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:55,648
Where do you think you're going?

603
00:37:56,691 --> 00:37:57,733
What are you doing?

604
00:37:57,817 --> 00:37:59,860
What? You have no idea who I am, do you?

605
00:37:59,944 --> 00:38:02,738
Wait, let go of me first. Who are you?

606
00:38:02,822 --> 00:38:05,283
I'm Min-sik's girlfriend.

607
00:38:05,366 --> 00:38:07,827
Who is Min-sik…

608
00:38:09,537 --> 00:38:12,456
What are you doing?
Let go of her. Let's talk it out.

609
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,378
I think this woman's crazy.

610
00:38:17,461 --> 00:38:20,256
You were in a room here
with Min-sik just an hour ago,

611
00:38:20,339 --> 00:38:22,591
and now you're getting a room
with another guy?

612
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,218
What a piece of trash.

613
00:38:24,302 --> 00:38:27,388
What are you talking about?
I don't even know who Min-sik is.

614
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,223
So you're going to play dumb?

615
00:38:30,766 --> 00:38:31,684
Isn't this you?

616
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:34,395
This…

617
00:38:35,771 --> 00:38:36,897
Why, that--

618
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:38,983
She does look similar, but…

619
00:38:39,942 --> 00:38:43,154
Okay, she and I look similar, but…

620
00:38:43,237 --> 00:38:45,364
I'm sorry, but long hair is a common look.

621
00:38:45,448 --> 00:38:48,826
And these clothes are new this season,
so many people wear them.

622
00:38:48,909 --> 00:38:50,119
Anyway, that's not me.

623
00:38:50,202 --> 00:38:52,038
So you're going to keep lying.

624
00:38:53,622 --> 00:38:55,082
You little--

625
00:38:56,208 --> 00:38:59,086
Why don't you go get
your boyfriend under control?

626
00:38:59,754 --> 00:39:03,007
It takes two to cheat,
it's not something she did on her own.

627
00:39:04,133 --> 00:39:04,967
Let's go.

628
00:39:10,222 --> 00:39:12,433
Those bastards!

629
00:39:15,478 --> 00:39:17,855
Mr. Cha, where are you?
I just came out of the lobby.

630
00:39:19,565 --> 00:39:20,524
Okay.

631
00:39:23,486 --> 00:39:27,198
<i>What the hell? I've just become
some crazy, cheating bitch.</i>

632
00:39:27,281 --> 00:39:29,033
<i>This is so embarrassing.</i>

633
00:39:29,825 --> 00:39:32,828
<i>No. Maybe this is for the better.</i>

634
00:39:34,830 --> 00:39:36,082
It takes two to cheat?

635
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:39,418
How dare you accuse me of two-timing?

636
00:39:39,502 --> 00:39:42,755
-Are you saying it's a misunderstanding?
-Yes. Two-timing?

637
00:39:43,422 --> 00:39:45,007
I've never done that in my life.

638
00:39:45,091 --> 00:39:48,386
Though I have seen three
or four guys at the same time.

639
00:39:50,137 --> 00:39:53,182
-What?
-I really like men.

640
00:39:54,809 --> 00:39:57,812
I know you like honesty,
but this is a bit much, right?

641
00:39:57,895 --> 00:39:58,896
Hey!

642
00:39:59,772 --> 00:40:00,815
Stop right there!

643
00:40:01,482 --> 00:40:03,943
I'm going to leave
before anything worse happens to me.

644
00:40:04,026 --> 00:40:05,778
Bye!

645
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:08,781
Hey, wait--

646
00:40:12,451 --> 00:40:14,662
I'm sorry.

647
00:40:15,538 --> 00:40:16,414
What…

648
00:40:20,918 --> 00:40:24,672
Stop, you bitch!

649
00:40:28,968 --> 00:40:29,969
Mr. Kang.

650
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:31,053
Let's just go.

651
00:40:31,137 --> 00:40:33,597
Didn't you say you were
driving Ms. Jin home?

652
00:40:34,306 --> 00:40:36,559
-She's over there, leaving.
-Pardon?

653
00:40:36,642 --> 00:40:40,479
Stop right there, you bitch!

654
00:40:43,858 --> 00:40:46,944
So she got caught
having an affair and ran?

655
00:40:47,027 --> 00:40:49,363
Yes. She said she really likes men

656
00:40:49,447 --> 00:40:51,907
and that she sees
three to four guys at a time.

657
00:40:53,117 --> 00:40:54,743
She sounds like the worst.

658
00:40:56,370 --> 00:41:00,541
What else? Samantha and Rachel?

659
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,544
-What does that mean?
-Don't ask.

660
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:06,380
-Sounds like it was a big waste of time.
-Maybe.

661
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:13,012
Yes.

662
00:41:13,971 --> 00:41:15,764
We just said bye, and I'm heading home.

663
00:41:15,848 --> 00:41:17,308
The date's over already?

664
00:41:18,142 --> 00:41:19,560
Sounds like it didn't work out.

665
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:23,147
Fine, let me talk to Sung-hoon.

666
00:41:23,230 --> 00:41:25,191
So we can schedule the next date.

667
00:41:25,274 --> 00:41:26,442
There's no need for that.

668
00:41:26,525 --> 00:41:27,568
What?

669
00:41:27,651 --> 00:41:30,571
You're going to break your promise
and stop going on these dates?

670
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:31,864
No.

671
00:41:31,947 --> 00:41:35,159
I'm going to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo,
the lady I met tonight.

672
00:41:36,452 --> 00:41:38,162
You, what?

673
00:41:43,125 --> 00:41:48,547
How on earth could the blind date
be the president of your company?

674
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:52,092
So? How did it go?

675
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:53,552
How do you think it went?

676
00:41:56,722 --> 00:41:58,599
I just did my job!

677
00:41:58,682 --> 00:42:00,059
Oh, come on!

678
00:42:00,142 --> 00:42:02,895
I used all the personalities
that guys hate,

679
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,147
so I'm sure he won't contact you again.

680
00:42:06,023 --> 00:42:09,276
Thank you for completing the mission
even in a situation like that.

681
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,986
You're a true friend.

682
00:42:13,239 --> 00:42:14,907
To partners in crime?

683
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:16,534
Yes, of course.

684
00:42:16,617 --> 00:42:17,826
I'm so proud of you.

685
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:21,705
You've worked hard,
so I'll get the next round of drinks too.

686
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:25,334
Thanks.

687
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,630
<i>I'm the only one who can see him</i>

688
00:42:30,839 --> 00:42:33,384
Hey! Why do you keep
ending my songs early?

689
00:42:33,467 --> 00:42:34,927
It's depressing!

690
00:42:35,010 --> 00:42:37,763
You're just adding more stress,
not relieving it.

691
00:42:37,846 --> 00:42:39,890
Ballads relieve stress better.

692
00:42:39,974 --> 00:42:41,934
By expressing how it feels to love--

693
00:42:44,520 --> 00:42:45,646
I'm not doing it.

694
00:42:58,868 --> 00:43:01,204
One, two, three, go!

695
00:43:01,870 --> 00:43:05,374
<i>I want to tell you
Even though you can only hear me</i>

696
00:43:05,457 --> 00:43:09,795
<i>After the sad times have passed</i>

697
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:15,551
<i>Close your eyes and feel my heart</i>

698
00:43:15,634 --> 00:43:18,470
<i>And my eyes looking toward you</i>

699
00:43:18,554 --> 00:43:23,392
<i>I love you, just like this feeling</i>

700
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:27,730
<i>This is the end of the wandering
That I have dreamed of</i>

701
00:43:27,813 --> 00:43:29,732
<i>It keeps repeating in this world</i>

702
00:43:29,815 --> 00:43:32,359
Dad? Is he calling about the blind date?

703
00:43:36,155 --> 00:43:37,156
Yes, Dad?

704
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:45,539
I got 100 points?

705
00:43:45,623 --> 00:43:50,878
I got 100 points! Yes! 100 points!

706
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,588
I got 100 points!

707
00:43:52,671 --> 00:43:54,798
Young-seo, I got a 100!

708
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,301
I got 100 points!

709
00:43:58,218 --> 00:43:59,470
Ha-ri,

710
00:43:59,553 --> 00:44:01,388
what did you do?

711
00:44:01,472 --> 00:44:05,100
What do you mean? I sang my heart out!

712
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:06,644
Not that!

713
00:44:08,520 --> 00:44:11,899
What did you do to make
President Kang want to marry me?

714
00:44:11,982 --> 00:44:14,485
What? He wants to marry you?

715
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,446
Not me, you.

716
00:44:17,529 --> 00:44:23,160
You're the one who went on the blind date.
Tell me what happened!

717
00:44:23,243 --> 00:44:25,329
Ha-ri!

718
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:27,164
What?

719
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:30,584
<i>Are you really going
to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo?</i>

720
00:44:30,668 --> 00:44:33,962
-Yes, how many times do you have to ask?
-I just find it hard to believe.

721
00:44:34,046 --> 00:44:35,381
She two-timed--

722
00:44:35,464 --> 00:44:37,800
To marry a woman who dates
as many men as she likes?

723
00:44:37,883 --> 00:44:39,802
Why is her past any problem?

724
00:44:39,885 --> 00:44:42,805
Because I feel like it will be a problem
even after getting married.

725
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:44,973
I mean, she seemed like quite the woman.

726
00:44:45,057 --> 00:44:46,850
Of course she is.
She's from the Marine Group.

727
00:44:46,934 --> 00:44:50,437
Like Grandfather said, she'll be
a good asset for me. Should I let her go?

728
00:44:50,521 --> 00:44:53,107
Still, you should marry someone
that you love--

729
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:55,150
Love? What is love?

730
00:44:55,734 --> 00:44:58,862
You miss them
even when they're right there with you,

731
00:44:59,988 --> 00:45:02,616
and your heart flutters
when you think about them.

732
00:45:02,699 --> 00:45:05,077
I don't want to cling to mere emotion.

733
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,454
And wasting time
on blind dates is even worse.

734
00:45:08,705 --> 00:45:10,124
Besides, I like Ms. Jin.

735
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:14,128
She's very open and honest.

736
00:45:17,965 --> 00:45:20,717
Come on, fold them right.
You keep messing it up.

737
00:45:21,802 --> 00:45:25,472
That wasn't me.
Those are the ones Ha-min made.

738
00:45:26,974 --> 00:45:30,352
Come on. I'm good at folding.

739
00:45:31,061 --> 00:45:32,855
I gave up on soccer as a kid,

740
00:45:32,938 --> 00:45:35,190
gave up becoming a celebrity
in middle school,

741
00:45:35,274 --> 00:45:37,401
and gave up studying in high school too.

742
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:38,569
Good for you!

743
00:45:45,576 --> 00:45:48,662
I heard you gave the guy money
for his store sign and hospital bills.

744
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:52,666
-Where did you get the money?
-I got a bonus from work.

745
00:45:53,167 --> 00:45:56,670
Didn't you say things at work were weird
because of the new president?

746
00:45:56,753 --> 00:45:58,839
But he handed out bonuses right away?

747
00:45:58,922 --> 00:46:00,591
He seems pretty cool.

748
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:04,094
Did you see him? Didn't you say
he's the chairman's grandson?

749
00:46:04,178 --> 00:46:05,929
-What does he look like?
-I don't know.

750
00:46:06,013 --> 00:46:08,682
-Is he handsome?
-I don't know!

751
00:46:08,765 --> 00:46:11,059
Why are you asking me? Don't ask!

752
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,644
Goodness.

753
00:46:13,687 --> 00:46:15,898
Why are you throwing a fit?

754
00:46:15,981 --> 00:46:18,025
Who else would I ask?

755
00:46:18,108 --> 00:46:20,444
She put on a show to stop folding boxes.

756
00:46:20,527 --> 00:46:22,279
Hey, Ha-ri, get your butt back here.

757
00:46:22,905 --> 00:46:25,240
She must be tired. Let her rest.

758
00:46:25,324 --> 00:46:27,618
I'll fold the boxes twice as fast.

759
00:46:27,701 --> 00:46:29,745
-Make that three times.
-Okay!

760
00:46:40,339 --> 00:46:42,007
Hello?

761
00:46:42,090 --> 00:46:45,761
I'm hiding out in a hotel right now
because of you, my friend.

762
00:46:45,844 --> 00:46:46,887
<i>Why a hotel?</i>

763
00:46:46,970 --> 00:46:49,473
Ever since President Kang
said he wanted to marry me,

764
00:46:49,556 --> 00:46:53,060
my old man's been trying to get
our families to meet up! So I ran!

765
00:46:54,186 --> 00:46:55,354
What are you going to do?

766
00:46:56,188 --> 00:46:58,524
You'd better clean up your mess.

767
00:46:58,607 --> 00:47:00,025
How is this my fault?

768
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:04,071
If he wants to marry you
even after the crazy act I pulled,

769
00:47:04,154 --> 00:47:06,323
I'm sure he's after your family.

770
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:08,283
You think so?

771
00:47:08,867 --> 00:47:11,411
People who have it all are
always the ones who want more.

772
00:47:11,495 --> 00:47:13,914
His family's much wealthier than mine.

773
00:47:13,997 --> 00:47:16,291
I told you we should go
with the exorcism stuff.

774
00:47:16,375 --> 00:47:20,462
I'll bet my right hand and empty wallet
that he still would've wanted to marry you

775
00:47:20,546 --> 00:47:22,923
even if we went all out with an exorcism.

776
00:47:23,006 --> 00:47:25,133
So what do I do now?

777
00:47:26,218 --> 00:47:27,636
Should I run away from home?

778
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:29,555
Or shave my head and become a monk?

779
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:32,057
Just meet President Kang
and tell him honestly.

780
00:47:32,140 --> 00:47:35,227
Tell him that the woman he wants
to marry isn't Jin Young-seo,

781
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:38,564
that you sent someone else
to ruin the blind date.

782
00:47:38,647 --> 00:47:42,192
Damn it, my dad is going to be so mad.

783
00:47:42,276 --> 00:47:44,736
But it'll stop all of this talk
about marriage.

784
00:47:45,988 --> 00:47:50,409
Just look on the bright side.
It's like a blessing in disguise.

785
00:47:50,993 --> 00:47:54,371
Wait, what if I run
into President Kang at work?

786
00:47:54,454 --> 00:47:55,747
Dang.

787
00:47:56,331 --> 00:47:58,083
I'm getting goosebumps.

788
00:47:58,166 --> 00:47:59,042
<i>Hey.</i>

789
00:47:59,126 --> 00:48:02,629
A regular employee will never
run into the president at work.

790
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:04,381
-<i>Don't worry about it.</i>
-You think so?

791
00:48:05,591 --> 00:48:06,925
Oh, wait.

792
00:48:15,517 --> 00:48:16,435
Wait for me!

793
00:48:16,518 --> 00:48:21,607
Damn it! Mr. Gye always gives me hell
if I arrive later than he does.

794
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,747
-Get in, miss.
-Pardon?

795
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,126
There's a lot of space, so hop in.

796
00:48:45,547 --> 00:48:46,840
Are you getting in or not?

797
00:48:48,050 --> 00:48:52,012
Well, I…

798
00:48:56,016 --> 00:49:00,145
<i>"A regular employee will never
run into the president at work"?</i>

799
00:49:00,228 --> 00:49:01,605
<i>Whatever.</i>

800
00:49:01,688 --> 00:49:04,900
Mr. Chairman, what brings you
to the office this early in the morning?

801
00:49:05,567 --> 00:49:07,986
It's my company. Am I not allowed to come?

802
00:49:08,695 --> 00:49:11,031
This brat made
a shocking declaration yesterday

803
00:49:11,114 --> 00:49:13,825
but didn't explain it,
so I followed him here.

804
00:49:13,909 --> 00:49:16,745
What is there to explain?
I told you everything yesterday.

805
00:49:16,828 --> 00:49:19,665
So you're really going to marry her?

806
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:22,417
Sir, let's discuss that upstairs.

807
00:49:32,886 --> 00:49:33,929
You there.

808
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:38,600
SENIOR RESEARCHER
SHIN HA-RI

809
00:49:38,684 --> 00:49:39,768
Ms. Shin Ha-ri?

810
00:49:39,851 --> 00:49:42,145
<i>What? Why is he calling me?</i>

811
00:49:42,229 --> 00:49:45,649
<i>No, wait, how does he even know my name?</i>

812
00:49:49,069 --> 00:49:49,903
Yes?

813
00:49:50,946 --> 00:49:52,531
You dropped your employee ID.

814
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:56,576
I see. Why did I drop that?

815
00:50:01,957 --> 00:50:03,208
Can you give it…

816
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:05,001
Oh, thank you.

817
00:50:06,503 --> 00:50:08,171
<i>Doors closing.</i>

818
00:50:10,757 --> 00:50:11,675
Shin Ha-ri?

819
00:50:15,929 --> 00:50:19,975
Are you really going to marry Young-seo?

820
00:50:20,058 --> 00:50:21,393
Shin Ha-ri.

821
00:50:22,018 --> 00:50:23,061
Shin Ha-ri?

822
00:50:24,646 --> 00:50:26,356
Shin Ha-ri.

823
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,234
EMPLOYEE PERSONAL RECORDS

824
00:50:29,317 --> 00:50:30,485
I was right.

825
00:50:31,111 --> 00:50:33,155
What do you mean, you were right?

826
00:50:33,238 --> 00:50:34,573
That employee back there.

827
00:50:34,656 --> 00:50:36,575
She made the proposal
for Bucket List Fish.

828
00:50:36,658 --> 00:50:38,285
Oh, really?

829
00:50:38,785 --> 00:50:41,913
She's the one you singled out
for coming up with the idea, right?

830
00:50:41,997 --> 00:50:43,790
I remembered her
because her name was unique.

831
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:46,168
I thought she was quite competent.

832
00:50:46,752 --> 00:50:49,713
-Even aside from the Bucket List Fish--
-Stop talking about work!

833
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:52,048
What's the big idea?

834
00:50:52,132 --> 00:50:53,467
What do you mean?

835
00:50:53,550 --> 00:50:56,386
You always said blind dates
were a waste of time.

836
00:50:56,970 --> 00:51:00,140
And now you want to get married
after one blind date?

837
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,143
I'm giving you that granddaughter-in-law
you want so badly.

838
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:04,561
Really?

839
00:51:04,644 --> 00:51:07,063
Does Young-seo want to marry you as well?

840
00:51:11,401 --> 00:51:12,611
What do you think?

841
00:51:13,945 --> 00:51:15,030
About what?

842
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:20,243
With my face, body, impeccable manners,
and flawless personality,

843
00:51:21,203 --> 00:51:22,537
why would she say no?

844
00:51:22,621 --> 00:51:25,624
You're right! No one would say no

845
00:51:25,707 --> 00:51:27,584
to my handsome grandson!

846
00:51:28,877 --> 00:51:30,045
Look at you.

847
00:51:32,672 --> 00:51:34,382
Who would say no to you?

848
00:51:36,134 --> 00:51:38,094
That's my boy.

849
00:51:38,762 --> 00:51:42,766
Was Young-seo really that good?

850
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:46,812
I'm not sure, sir.
I didn't get a good look at her.

851
00:51:49,272 --> 00:51:53,276
He lost his parents at a young age

852
00:51:53,777 --> 00:51:54,986
and I was

853
00:51:56,196 --> 00:52:00,951
always too busy to really be there
for him as his grandfather.

854
00:52:01,535 --> 00:52:04,621
How nice would it be

855
00:52:05,205 --> 00:52:09,584
for him to start his own family
and love and care for them?

856
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,713
This goes for you, too.

857
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,383
Aren't you going to get a girlfriend?

858
00:52:17,592 --> 00:52:20,387
Don't just work all the time
like my grandson.

859
00:52:20,470 --> 00:52:25,016
Go find a good girl for yourself
and introduce her to me.

860
00:52:27,018 --> 00:52:28,103
Okay?

861
00:52:30,063 --> 00:52:32,691
You ran into the president?
And in the elevator, of all places?

862
00:52:32,774 --> 00:52:35,277
Yeah! Do you have any idea
how scared I was?

863
00:52:36,069 --> 00:52:40,490
So meet with Mr. Kang as soon as possible
and take care of this situation!

864
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:44,286
Okay, fine. Don't worry.

865
00:52:44,369 --> 00:52:45,453
Okay.

866
00:52:46,037 --> 00:52:47,539
Things are not looking good.

867
00:52:49,249 --> 00:52:50,208
Are you okay?

868
00:52:50,292 --> 00:52:52,210
I told you not to fool around!

869
00:52:52,294 --> 00:52:53,503
Oh, I'm so sorry.

870
00:52:59,092 --> 00:53:00,093
Hey, kid.

871
00:53:01,177 --> 00:53:03,430
Is it okay to run around
with something like this?

872
00:53:05,932 --> 00:53:07,225
Not okay, right?

873
00:53:07,934 --> 00:53:11,187
If you promise not to do it again,
I'll show you a magic trick.

874
00:53:11,271 --> 00:53:12,147
Promise.

875
00:53:14,399 --> 00:53:15,358
Look.

876
00:53:20,739 --> 00:53:21,907
Ta-da!

877
00:53:21,990 --> 00:53:23,742
-Guess what this is.
-Poop?

878
00:53:24,784 --> 00:53:25,619
Poop?

879
00:53:26,369 --> 00:53:28,914
How does this look like poop?
It's a flower.

880
00:53:28,997 --> 00:53:32,334
Here's the bud,
and right here are the leaves.

881
00:53:34,127 --> 00:53:36,129
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is,

882
00:53:36,212 --> 00:53:38,840
you can't be running around
with things like this.

883
00:53:38,924 --> 00:53:40,884
Somebody might get hurt,

884
00:53:40,967 --> 00:53:43,762
or you might ruin somebody's outfit
that's worth a fortune, okay?

885
00:53:43,845 --> 00:53:45,430
-Okay.
-Good.

886
00:53:46,306 --> 00:53:48,058
Let me pay you for the dry cleaning.

887
00:53:48,141 --> 00:53:52,228
Oh, it's fine. I scribbled more
than he did anyway. Here you go.

888
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:54,522
Bye.

889
00:54:05,075 --> 00:54:07,911
Oh, right! My car keys and wallet.

890
00:54:11,623 --> 00:54:12,666
Oh, I'm sorry.

891
00:54:16,294 --> 00:54:17,504
Are you all right?

892
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,856
<i>He's handsome as hell.</i>

893
00:54:40,276 --> 00:54:42,529
<i>He's absolutely gorgeous.</i>

894
00:54:43,488 --> 00:54:45,782
<i>I've found my love.</i>

895
00:54:50,578 --> 00:54:53,456
Oh, yes. I'm sorry.

896
00:54:53,540 --> 00:54:54,582
It's no problem.

897
00:55:04,217 --> 00:55:08,388
I want to ask for his number so badly!

898
00:55:11,349 --> 00:55:12,225
Who is this?

899
00:55:14,269 --> 00:55:15,270
Hello?

900
00:55:15,353 --> 00:55:17,522
What? President Kang wants to meet you?

901
00:55:17,605 --> 00:55:19,607
Yeah, he just called me.

902
00:55:19,691 --> 00:55:22,027
That's great!
You can meet and tell him the truth!

903
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:27,282
My dear friend,
could you go instead of me?

904
00:55:27,365 --> 00:55:29,034
You must be crazy.

905
00:55:29,117 --> 00:55:30,952
I have an important meeting.

906
00:55:31,036 --> 00:55:33,621
Still. How can I go instead? No way.

907
00:55:33,705 --> 00:55:34,789
What if I get caught?

908
00:55:34,873 --> 00:55:36,041
Why would you get caught?

909
00:55:36,124 --> 00:55:38,418
Just go and say you don't like him.
That you won't marry him.

910
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,336
Just say no really clearly. Please?

911
00:55:42,964 --> 00:55:44,257
Forget it.

912
00:55:44,340 --> 00:55:48,678
Put off your meeting or take a rain check.
Take care of it yourself.

913
00:55:50,764 --> 00:55:53,308
You remember this scar here?

914
00:55:53,391 --> 00:55:56,686
When I tried to teach that flirty girl
following Min-woo around a lesson,

915
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,563
I slipped and hit my head on a rock.

916
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,234
Of course, I remember.

917
00:56:03,318 --> 00:56:05,195
You bled so much from your head

918
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:08,323
that you were called the Bloody Head
of Hannam-dong for a while.

919
00:56:19,250 --> 00:56:22,712
Why is it here, of all places?
It's so close to Min-woo's restaurant.

920
00:56:27,759 --> 00:56:30,053
Where is this guy?

921
00:56:30,136 --> 00:56:31,387
CALLING
JIN YOUNG-SEO

922
00:56:40,438 --> 00:56:41,689
Do you have two phones?

923
00:56:45,276 --> 00:56:46,778
Oh, that's--

924
00:56:48,404 --> 00:56:53,868
KANG TAE-MOO'S NUMBER

925
00:56:55,787 --> 00:56:58,206
How dare you just get my number like that?

926
00:56:58,289 --> 00:57:02,001
We're going to get married,
so I should know all your phone numbers.

927
00:57:06,172 --> 00:57:08,424
I'm not planning to marry you.

928
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:10,593
How can I marry
someone I've only met once?

929
00:57:10,677 --> 00:57:13,012
Then why did you ask me
to get a room with you?

930
00:57:13,805 --> 00:57:15,682
Wasn't it because you liked me?

931
00:57:18,059 --> 00:57:19,060
That was--

932
00:57:19,144 --> 00:57:23,106
And you showing up to the date
means you're willing to get married, no?

933
00:57:23,189 --> 00:57:24,983
I was forced to go.

934
00:57:25,066 --> 00:57:28,153
I hate arranged marriages,
especially for business reasons.

935
00:57:28,820 --> 00:57:32,031
Anyway, please just forget
about all this marriage talk.

936
00:57:43,918 --> 00:57:47,172
Don't be like that.
Let's just get married.

937
00:57:48,631 --> 00:57:51,342
Look here, do you think marriage
is some kind of joke?

938
00:57:51,426 --> 00:57:54,220
How could you ask
just anyone to marry you?

939
00:57:54,304 --> 00:57:57,599
Who says I'm going to marry just anyone?
The person I want to marry…

940
00:57:59,142 --> 00:57:59,976
is you.

941
00:58:03,188 --> 00:58:05,773
No way. I'm not going to marry
someone I barely know.

942
00:58:05,857 --> 00:58:07,984
-Then let's go on just ten dates.
-What?

943
00:58:08,067 --> 00:58:09,986
I'll give you a chance to get to know me.

944
00:58:10,069 --> 00:58:12,489
Once you do,
you'll learn I have a lot of strengths.

945
00:58:13,907 --> 00:58:15,450
And I'm quite good…

946
00:58:17,994 --> 00:58:19,078
at many things.

947
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,247
What do you mean, you're good--

948
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:40,725
What were you thinking about?

949
00:58:40,808 --> 00:58:42,560
I just meant that I'm good to women.

950
00:58:43,061 --> 00:58:46,564
I'm confident that you won't want
to see other men while seeing me.

951
00:58:48,525 --> 00:58:49,943
Forget it.

952
00:58:51,736 --> 00:58:55,406
I don't want to marry you or date you,

953
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,159
so I hope to never see you again.

954
00:59:12,048 --> 00:59:14,551
Is he crazy or just dying to get married?

955
00:59:14,634 --> 00:59:17,637
Anyway, I think I've said enough
for him to not contact me again.

956
00:59:21,641 --> 00:59:24,310
-Are you done already?
-Let's just go.

957
00:59:35,989 --> 00:59:39,033
Damn it, this is what I was worried about!

958
00:59:40,201 --> 00:59:42,453
I can't run into him looking like this!

959

EPISODE 2

2
00:00:55,889 --> 00:00:58,933
Damn it, this is what I was worried about!

3
00:01:00,185 --> 00:01:02,437
I can't run into him looking like this!

4
00:01:15,158 --> 00:01:16,159
What are you doing?

5
00:01:17,285 --> 00:01:18,286
I…

6
00:01:18,828 --> 00:01:19,996
So…

7
00:01:20,955 --> 00:01:22,290
I have something I need to tell you.

8
00:01:22,373 --> 00:01:24,250
-What is it?
-It's…

9
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,087
I just need a moment…

10
00:01:32,634 --> 00:01:36,346
Before, you said that you never
wanted to see my face or marry me.

11
00:01:36,429 --> 00:01:37,639
So what are you doing right now?

12
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:41,184
Exactly.

13
00:01:41,267 --> 00:01:44,103
Right. Not only do I not want
to see your face ever again

14
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:47,649
but I'm also not interested
in marrying you at all.

15
00:01:47,732 --> 00:01:51,903
So I came back to tell you to never
contact me again. Okay, I'll be going now.

16
00:01:51,986 --> 00:01:53,822
I'm still going to marry you.

17
00:01:57,992 --> 00:01:58,827
What?

18
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:01,162
So tell me why you don't want to marry me.

19
00:02:04,624 --> 00:02:06,668
I don't like everything about you.

20
00:02:06,751 --> 00:02:11,172
I don't like how cheesy
your weird lines are

21
00:02:11,256 --> 00:02:13,299
and how your face
looks like an archaeopteryx.

22
00:02:15,135 --> 00:02:15,969
An archaeopteryx?

23
00:02:17,679 --> 00:02:19,639
I'll be leaving now.

24
00:02:19,722 --> 00:02:21,516
Oh, it's a green light.

25
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,147
An archaeopteryx?

26
00:02:28,398 --> 00:02:29,983
What does that look like?

27
00:02:33,611 --> 00:02:34,863
This is an archaeopteryx.

28
00:02:35,655 --> 00:02:37,365
How do I look anything like this?

29
00:02:38,366 --> 00:02:41,953
Just the overall vibe,
especially the nose.

30
00:02:42,036 --> 00:02:42,871
What?

31
00:02:45,957 --> 00:02:47,458
The resemblance is uncanny.

32
00:02:55,925 --> 00:02:58,845
What? How can you laugh
in a situation like this?

33
00:02:58,928 --> 00:03:01,723
No, I mean, the whole thing is hilarious.

34
00:03:01,806 --> 00:03:05,435
So you're telling me,
you jumped in the car and said,

35
00:03:05,518 --> 00:03:06,603
"I don't want to marry you."

36
00:03:06,686 --> 00:03:09,731
I had no choice. I couldn't
run into Min-woo looking like that.

37
00:03:09,814 --> 00:03:11,900
Anyway, what do we do now?

38
00:03:11,983 --> 00:03:14,527
He'll push ahead with the wedding
if we don't do something about it.

39
00:03:14,611 --> 00:03:15,862
You're right.

40
00:03:15,945 --> 00:03:18,197
Why does he even want
to get married so badly?

41
00:03:18,281 --> 00:03:20,450
I told you,
he's probably after your family

42
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,493
so his family can become the wealthiest.

43
00:03:22,577 --> 00:03:26,456
Even if the two companies merge,
that's still not enough capital, though.

44
00:03:27,248 --> 00:03:29,083
Maybe he's actually just fallen for you.

45
00:03:29,167 --> 00:03:30,668
That's impossible.

46
00:03:30,752 --> 00:03:34,005
He's probably interested in
"Jin Young-seo from Marine Group."

47
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:36,883
Anyway, go meet him
and clear this whole thing up.

48
00:03:36,966 --> 00:03:37,926
Fine.

49
00:03:38,009 --> 00:03:39,344
BASED ON WEBNOVEL AND WEBTOON
<i>A BUSINESS PROPOSAL</i>

50
00:03:40,094 --> 00:03:41,346
I'm tired. Let's get going.

51
00:03:42,222 --> 00:03:46,017
Come on. Let's go
for just one more round of drinks.

52
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,435
-What?
-If my dad comes back and finds out

53
00:03:47,518 --> 00:03:50,647
that I made a complete mess
of the blind date, I'm dead.

54
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:55,902
Just one more drink. Think of it
as my last meal before I die, okay?

55
00:04:00,365 --> 00:04:02,283
Fine. Let's go for another round.

56
00:04:03,076 --> 00:04:04,077
Let's go!

57
00:04:04,160 --> 00:04:05,370
Young-seo.

58
00:04:07,830 --> 00:04:08,790
Hey, Ha-ri.

59
00:04:10,124 --> 00:04:11,459
What are you doing?

60
00:04:12,043 --> 00:04:14,671
Remember that guy
I told you about last time?

61
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,881
That's where we met.

62
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:18,633
What?

63
00:04:18,716 --> 00:04:20,343
He was so my type.

64
00:04:20,426 --> 00:04:23,638
I think he works somewhere around here.
Let's wait a bit, please?

65
00:04:23,721 --> 00:04:27,475
Wow, that guy's the reason you decided
to come here in the first place, isn't it?

66
00:04:27,558 --> 00:04:28,893
You're right.

67
00:04:28,977 --> 00:04:32,021
I mean, I've never felt so right
about anything else in my life.

68
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:35,692
So let's just wait for one more hour.
How's that sound?

69
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:39,487
Fine. Okay.

70
00:04:40,113 --> 00:04:42,198
Just one hour! I'll pick up the tab here.

71
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:52,041
Wow, can you believe these girls?

72
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:55,336
After coming home drunk last night,
they drank even more.

73
00:04:55,420 --> 00:04:58,131
Why I ought to…

74
00:04:58,923 --> 00:04:59,966
Wake up!

75
00:05:00,049 --> 00:05:02,135
-Don't you have to go to work?
-My head hurts.

76
00:05:03,177 --> 00:05:04,304
Mrs. Han.

77
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,639
Why did I fall asleep here?

78
00:05:06,723 --> 00:05:09,142
-What are you doing here?
-I don't know.

79
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:11,227
Do you not remember
what happened yesterday?

80
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:12,729
Yesterday?

81
00:05:18,693 --> 00:05:21,612
Look at this girl. Your sister's
not picking up her phone again.

82
00:05:21,696 --> 00:05:24,657
This little brat. She's dead meat.

83
00:05:29,287 --> 00:05:30,913
Ta-da!

84
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:33,374
I come bearing gifts.

85
00:05:33,458 --> 00:05:36,961
This one's for Dad, Mom, and Ha-min.

86
00:05:37,045 --> 00:05:39,297
And this one's for me!

87
00:05:39,380 --> 00:05:40,882
Look at you. Did you get into a fight?

88
00:05:40,965 --> 00:05:43,593
Oh, right. Mom, I tripped over there.

89
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:45,595
Would you look at yourself right now?

90
00:05:45,678 --> 00:05:51,309
But these really nice police officers
drove us here, like this!

91
00:05:51,392 --> 00:05:54,562
You got wasted and what? The police?

92
00:05:54,645 --> 00:05:55,730
I can't believe you!

93
00:05:55,813 --> 00:05:57,190
Just get inside!

94
00:05:57,273 --> 00:05:58,483
She's here too!

95
00:05:58,566 --> 00:06:02,028
Gosh, how much do you have to drink
to not be able to walk like this?

96
00:06:02,695 --> 00:06:04,113
Good evening.

97
00:06:04,197 --> 00:06:06,157
-Wow.
-Miss.

98
00:06:06,991 --> 00:06:09,702
All right, miss. You're home now, okay?

99
00:06:09,786 --> 00:06:14,040
No, I wasn't asking you
to help me find my house.

100
00:06:14,123 --> 00:06:17,752
I was asking you to help me
find the man I'm destined to be with.

101
00:06:17,835 --> 00:06:19,420
Hold on.

102
00:06:19,504 --> 00:06:22,340
I've been telling you.

103
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:28,679
He's about this tall, and his eyes sparkle
like a little puppy's.

104
00:06:28,763 --> 00:06:33,726
And his shoulders were as wide
as the Pacific Ocean. Whoosh, like that.

105
00:06:35,353 --> 00:06:38,147
-That hurts!
-Young-seo, you can't do that to…

106
00:06:38,231 --> 00:06:41,901
You're going to get into trouble
if you do that to the police.

107
00:06:41,984 --> 00:06:44,987
Come here. I'm so sorry.

108
00:06:45,488 --> 00:06:49,158
Hey! You haven't been hearing what
I've been trying to tell you all night.

109
00:06:50,618 --> 00:06:56,332
Is it so wrong that I want to meet the man
I'm destined to be with one more time?

110
00:06:56,415 --> 00:06:59,585
You've been going on and on
with that nonsense for hours now.

111
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:01,212
I'll rip your whole mouth off.

112
00:07:03,005 --> 00:07:04,048
Young-seo!

113
00:07:05,341 --> 00:07:07,635
Hey, what's wrong with your mouth?

114
00:07:07,718 --> 00:07:10,847
Young-seo, your mouth's ripped!

115
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:12,348
-It's ripped open?
-Let me see!

116
00:07:12,431 --> 00:07:15,643
-It's ripped.
-It ripped!

117
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:20,648
No! Mom, fire, blood, needle!

118
00:07:20,731 --> 00:07:22,358
Say, "Ah!"

119
00:07:26,237 --> 00:07:27,321
I'm sorry, Young-seo!

120
00:07:27,405 --> 00:07:30,366
It hurts. My heart hurts.

121
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:32,368
-I'm sorry.
-I think I'm going to throw up.

122
00:07:32,452 --> 00:07:35,079
That doesn't sound good at all.
No throwing up.

123
00:07:35,163 --> 00:07:37,748
She's never acted out her whole life,
but now here she is,

124
00:07:37,832 --> 00:07:40,710
driving the dagger
into our hearts with this scene.

125
00:07:40,793 --> 00:07:42,336
-I'm so sorry.
-Oh, it's okay.

126
00:07:42,420 --> 00:07:43,463
I'll take those.

127
00:07:43,546 --> 00:07:44,755
Oh, you can give it here.

128
00:07:44,839 --> 00:07:46,674
Thank you for your hard work.

129
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,470
I'll take care of this mess
and make sure they're sorry.

130
00:07:50,553 --> 00:07:51,679
You can leave now.

131
00:07:51,762 --> 00:07:52,972
-Oh, okay.
-Goodbye.

132
00:07:53,055 --> 00:07:54,182
Good night.

133
00:07:54,265 --> 00:07:55,725
-No throwing up.
-I'm sorry.

134
00:07:55,808 --> 00:07:56,809
Take care, then.

135
00:07:56,893 --> 00:07:59,353
Young-seo, you can't throw up.

136
00:07:59,437 --> 00:08:02,231
Let's go for one more round.

137
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:08,779
Go upstairs right now!

138
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:16,621
Last night, we…

139
00:08:16,704 --> 00:08:18,915
Let's cut back on drinking from now on.

140
00:08:19,832 --> 00:08:21,042
Shall we?

141
00:08:21,125 --> 00:08:22,293
-Yes.
-Okay.

142
00:08:27,048 --> 00:08:28,466
I love you, Mom.

143
00:08:28,549 --> 00:08:29,967
I love you, Ms. Han.

144
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:34,347
-Enjoy.
-Thank you.

145
00:08:34,889 --> 00:08:41,354
About the wedding, we should
probably have it at our hotel, right?

146
00:08:41,938 --> 00:08:43,481
What? The wedding?

147
00:08:43,564 --> 00:08:46,859
Yes. I was going to talk about it
with Chairman Jin,

148
00:08:46,943 --> 00:08:49,904
but he's on a business trip abroad
and isn't coming back until next week.

149
00:08:49,987 --> 00:08:52,031
Does he not know time is of the essence?

150
00:08:52,114 --> 00:08:54,534
You're thinking
about the wedding venue already?

151
00:08:54,617 --> 00:08:56,077
You hate wasting time.

152
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,288
Marriage is already on the table.
The faster we get this going,

153
00:08:59,372 --> 00:09:02,792
the faster I'll get to see
some great-grandkids, right?

154
00:09:04,961 --> 00:09:05,795
The thing is--

155
00:09:05,878 --> 00:09:08,965
That girl used to cause
a scene on blind dates.

156
00:09:09,048 --> 00:09:13,886
But she seems to have fallen in love
at first sight with my dear grandson.

157
00:09:15,346 --> 00:09:18,432
You two are meant to be.

158
00:09:19,016 --> 00:09:20,351
Oh, man.

159
00:09:21,394 --> 00:09:24,272
-Your phone keeps ringing.
-What?

160
00:09:25,690 --> 00:09:27,483
A NEW MESSAGE FROM JIN YOUNG-SEO

161
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:32,113
Indeed, she seems to have fallen
head over heels. She wants to see me.

162
00:09:32,196 --> 00:09:33,531
Really? Let me see.

163
00:09:33,614 --> 00:09:34,574
Hey, show me.

164
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:35,575
Let's eat.

165
00:09:39,662 --> 00:09:41,789
I got a text from President Kang.

166
00:09:44,041 --> 00:09:46,085
"I'll tell you where we'll meet later."

167
00:09:46,168 --> 00:09:49,839
Don't mess this up. Don't go around saying
anything stupid and blowing my cover.

168
00:09:49,922 --> 00:09:51,716
Who showed up to the blind date again?

169
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:56,846
I hired her through an agency to act
the part. She's a complete stranger.

170
00:09:56,929 --> 00:09:59,473
-Happy now?
-Just go and tell him that, okay?

171
00:09:59,557 --> 00:10:01,225
-Okay. Let's go.
-Let's go.

172
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:02,351
It'll finally be over.

173
00:10:02,435 --> 00:10:04,604
Why does she want to see you again?

174
00:10:04,687 --> 00:10:06,564
I thought she ended things last night.

175
00:10:06,647 --> 00:10:08,149
-Isn't it obvious?
-What is?

176
00:10:08,232 --> 00:10:10,359
She realized I'm
too good of a man to reject

177
00:10:10,443 --> 00:10:13,070
just to rebel against her father.

178
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,156
I don't think that's the case.

179
00:10:15,781 --> 00:10:17,408
She said that you're cheesy

180
00:10:17,491 --> 00:10:20,870
and that she doesn't like your face
because it looks like an archaeopteryx.

181
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,664
-Then why would she ask to see me again?
-I have no idea.

182
00:10:25,333 --> 00:10:29,378
Wow, Ms. Jin really has a keen eye.

183
00:10:29,462 --> 00:10:31,297
You really look like an archaeopter--

184
00:10:31,380 --> 00:10:33,633
Stop talking about the archaeopteryx.

185
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:39,597
-They look exactly the same!
-Hey, what did you just say?

186
00:10:40,389 --> 00:10:41,599
Wait, Mr. Cha!

187
00:10:41,682 --> 00:10:43,142
That looks good.

188
00:10:43,225 --> 00:10:46,020
Right, about the mackerel.
How's the curing coming along?

189
00:10:46,103 --> 00:10:48,606
-I'll pan-fry them today.
-Okay

190
00:10:48,689 --> 00:10:51,359
I guess I'll stink all day again.

191
00:10:52,276 --> 00:10:55,821
If I knew I'd be doing this all day,
I never would've started working here.

192
00:10:55,905 --> 00:10:56,822
I know, right?

193
00:10:56,906 --> 00:10:59,492
Please, Ms. Shin,
don't say things you don't mean.

194
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,911
You're always so excited
when you're working.

195
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:04,664
-Me? I am?
-Yes.

196
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:09,794
Wow, I can't believe it.

197
00:11:10,711 --> 00:11:15,174
The more I find out about President Kang,
the more I learn we have a lot in common.

198
00:11:17,218 --> 00:11:18,594
What do you have in common?

199
00:11:19,762 --> 00:11:21,514
Rumor has it that

200
00:11:21,597 --> 00:11:24,642
President Kang was the top of his class
when he was at Harvard.

201
00:11:24,725 --> 00:11:27,436
I was also the top of my class
for a semester in college.

202
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:31,148
Also, he got a gold medal at the Amateur
National Track and Field Championships.

203
00:11:31,232 --> 00:11:32,358
You all know, right?

204
00:11:32,441 --> 00:11:36,904
I am Gye Bin, the winner
of our company field day relay race.

205
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:39,615
Hey, what do you call this?

206
00:11:40,616 --> 00:11:41,992
Parallel universes.

207
00:11:42,827 --> 00:11:44,036
How can we be so alike?

208
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:49,250
You know what? Then I have so many things
in common with Gianna Jun.

209
00:11:49,333 --> 00:11:52,336
We both have two eyes, one nose, one mouth
and we're both women.

210
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:54,588
How dare you compare yourself
to my Gianna?

211
00:11:54,672 --> 00:11:57,091
Then why do you keep saying things
to tick me off?

212
00:11:57,174 --> 00:11:59,927
I know you have
no intention of ever getting married.

213
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,345
Here they go again.

214
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,223
To other female employees,
it's really useful information.

215
00:12:04,306 --> 00:12:07,226
It could be an opportunity
to climb up the ladder, you know?

216
00:12:07,309 --> 00:12:08,185
What?

217
00:12:08,269 --> 00:12:09,186
Sure, okay.

218
00:12:09,270 --> 00:12:13,274
Goodness, how do you always know
exactly what to say

219
00:12:13,357 --> 00:12:15,109
-to get your face smashed in?
-What?

220
00:12:15,192 --> 00:12:17,736
Stop saying "female employees."
They're just employees.

221
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:19,947
Don't you know that's sexist?

222
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:22,074
And, what, climb up the ladder?

223
00:12:22,158 --> 00:12:24,493
The only thing that's climbing
is my blood pressure.

224
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:26,787
So stop it
and get those invoices submitted.

225
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:29,874
That's why she's still single.

226
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,130
INCOMING CALL
MIN-WOO

227
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:40,134
Hi, Min-woo.

228
00:12:40,634 --> 00:12:42,052
-Min-woo?
-Oh, okay.

229
00:12:46,265 --> 00:12:47,349
-Ms. Yeo.
-Yes?

230
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:49,268
May I step out for a moment?

231
00:12:49,351 --> 00:12:51,729
Who was that on the phone?
You sound so happy.

232
00:12:51,812 --> 00:12:53,147
Yes, it's…

233
00:12:53,230 --> 00:12:54,231
my fling.

234
00:12:54,315 --> 00:12:56,734
Wow, that was a loud whisper.

235
00:12:57,443 --> 00:12:58,569
Okay.

236
00:13:01,822 --> 00:13:04,241
What? Min-woo's her fling?

237
00:13:04,325 --> 00:13:05,868
A fling.

238
00:13:05,951 --> 00:13:07,161
Ms. Kim.

239
00:13:07,661 --> 00:13:11,165
I'm asking because I'm curious,
but what exactly is a fling?

240
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:14,585
Is that what you call the phase
before you start to actually date…

241
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:17,296
I'm sorry.

242
00:13:18,214 --> 00:13:20,257
I should ask someone who'd know.

243
00:13:20,925 --> 00:13:22,510
I'm really sorry.

244
00:13:25,095 --> 00:13:28,682
What do you mean?
I have a lot of experience in that area.

245
00:13:30,059 --> 00:13:31,227
Feel free to ask me.

246
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:33,020
No, I'm sorry for asking.

247
00:13:49,286 --> 00:13:53,249
What? Are those two really a thing?

248
00:13:59,338 --> 00:14:00,673
There's no way.

249
00:14:01,173 --> 00:14:04,385
They've only met a couple of times
during our team dinners.

250
00:14:04,927 --> 00:14:06,095
Right.

251
00:14:09,306 --> 00:14:12,101
What's with all the touching?

252
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:17,231
Were they close enough to exchange gifts?

253
00:14:18,232 --> 00:14:19,567
He's leaving?

254
00:14:19,650 --> 00:14:20,859
Wait!

255
00:14:22,653 --> 00:14:23,487
What do I do?

256
00:14:37,960 --> 00:14:40,629
Ha-ri, you're so pathetic.

257
00:14:40,713 --> 00:14:42,548
What are you even doing?

258
00:14:57,771 --> 00:15:00,649
Have you taken care of that thing
we talked about yesterday?

259
00:15:00,733 --> 00:15:02,735
-Yes, sir. It's taken care of.
-Excuse me.

260
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:06,906
Sorry.

261
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,918
I'm sorry.

262
00:15:23,881 --> 00:15:26,175
Sir, are you all right?

263
00:15:31,055 --> 00:15:31,889
Who was it?

264
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,642
Who threw this at my face?

265
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:36,894
Sir, your nose is bleeding.

266
00:15:37,937 --> 00:15:39,021
My nose is bleeding?

267
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:44,443
That woman in the white lab coat.

268
00:15:45,194 --> 00:15:46,779
Oh, come on!

269
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:50,491
President Kang!

270
00:15:53,535 --> 00:15:55,621
Please open this for me.

271
00:15:57,873 --> 00:15:59,083
I'm so out of breath.

272
00:16:06,048 --> 00:16:08,050
What, why?

273
00:16:20,354 --> 00:16:21,188
Stop right there!

274
00:16:21,271 --> 00:16:22,189
Damn it!

275
00:16:22,272 --> 00:16:24,984
That little… Damn it!

276
00:16:36,662 --> 00:16:38,580
Damn.

277
00:16:47,256 --> 00:16:48,507
President Kang!

278
00:16:51,093 --> 00:16:52,636
Everyone's going to see.

279
00:17:08,694 --> 00:17:09,945
Oh, no!

280
00:17:17,494 --> 00:17:18,787
What are you doing here?

281
00:17:19,538 --> 00:17:20,914
She must be a researcher.

282
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,292
The Food Product Development Team
is upstairs.

283
00:17:23,375 --> 00:17:24,626
No, she went this way.

284
00:18:16,178 --> 00:18:18,013
This slipper belongs to you, doesn't it?

285
00:18:20,182 --> 00:18:22,226
I'm asking you why you threw this at me.

286
00:18:24,853 --> 00:18:27,773
I didn't mean to.
It was a mistake, I slipped.

287
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,483
SENIOR RESEARCHER
SHIN HA-RI

288
00:18:32,402 --> 00:18:34,863
Ms. Shin Ha-ri, I can't hear
a word you're saying.

289
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:39,201
I didn't mean to. It was a mistake.
I slipped. I'm sorry.

290
00:18:40,244 --> 00:18:41,495
Then why did you run?

291
00:18:42,079 --> 00:18:46,041
<i>I can't say it's because I thought you
might recognize my face!</i>

292
00:18:47,084 --> 00:18:50,838
I was surprised
because your nose was bleeding. I'm sorry.

293
00:19:03,642 --> 00:19:04,476
Put it back on.

294
00:19:05,477 --> 00:19:06,770
Thank you.

295
00:19:09,523 --> 00:19:11,984
The Bucket List Fish was your work, right?

296
00:19:12,693 --> 00:19:13,569
Yes.

297
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:16,196
And the vegetarian
dumplings campaign too, right?

298
00:19:17,322 --> 00:19:18,740
Yes.

299
00:19:20,909 --> 00:19:23,412
Huh? That proposal wasn't ever approved.
How did you--

300
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,581
I remember
because the idea was pretty good.

301
00:19:25,664 --> 00:19:27,791
Right?

302
00:19:27,875 --> 00:19:31,420
If you think about it,
my ideas were ahead of their time.

303
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:32,713
It would be perfect now.

304
00:19:32,796 --> 00:19:36,341
Being vegan is trending these days.
Vegetable dumplings without calories!

305
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:38,969
It would have been popular
with the vegetarians

306
00:19:39,052 --> 00:19:41,972
as well as with anybody on a diet.
It's such a shame.

307
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:47,936
My mackerel!
The curing should be done by now!

308
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:50,063
I'll be going now.

309
00:19:51,481 --> 00:19:54,651
She acts awfully strange,
but I like the way she works.

310
00:19:58,864 --> 00:20:00,741
What's up? What's bothering you?

311
00:20:00,824 --> 00:20:03,702
What? Oh, no.

312
00:20:05,621 --> 00:20:08,999
This is no time to be working.
Do you know what happened?

313
00:20:09,082 --> 00:20:12,085
Some employee threw a slipper
at President Kang

314
00:20:12,794 --> 00:20:14,338
in the lobby on the first floor.

315
00:20:16,006 --> 00:20:17,174
He even got a nosebleed!

316
00:20:19,843 --> 00:20:22,387
Hey, Ms. Kim. You were
on the first floor earlier, right?

317
00:20:22,471 --> 00:20:23,597
Did you see anything?

318
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:25,849
I didn't see anything.

319
00:20:27,059 --> 00:20:30,938
You said you were going to see your fling.
What's with all the head banging?

320
00:20:31,021 --> 00:20:34,149
As of today, I'm no longer in a fling.

321
00:20:34,733 --> 00:20:38,946
The guy I was talking about
was Chef Lee Min-woo.

322
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,990
Oh, Min-woo?

323
00:20:42,074 --> 00:20:45,035
You're talking about Ms. Shin's friend
who was at the restaurant

324
00:20:45,118 --> 00:20:47,663
when we were having our company dinner?
The handsome guy?

325
00:20:47,746 --> 00:20:48,872
Oh, that guy?

326
00:20:49,373 --> 00:20:50,999
Wait, but you barely know him.

327
00:20:51,083 --> 00:20:54,503
Well, he was totally my type,
so I texted him first,

328
00:20:54,586 --> 00:20:57,172
and I even left him a present
at his restaurant.

329
00:20:57,256 --> 00:21:00,259
Then why is it already over?
You even gave him a gift.

330
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:01,426
Right.

331
00:21:02,010 --> 00:21:03,762
He said he felt uncomfortable or whatever.

332
00:21:06,598 --> 00:21:08,058
Oh, I see.

333
00:21:09,017 --> 00:21:12,479
I'm going to go take out the mackerel now.

334
00:21:20,737 --> 00:21:22,489
Can't you read the room?

335
00:21:22,572 --> 00:21:24,491
What? What did I do?

336
00:21:24,574 --> 00:21:27,619
Don't you know Chef Lee
already has someone he's interested in?

337
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:28,745
No way.

338
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:32,457
Ms. Yeo, have you no shame?

339
00:21:32,541 --> 00:21:35,043
He's young enough to be your nephew.

340
00:21:35,127 --> 00:21:36,920
Don't even think about it!

341
00:21:37,004 --> 00:21:39,131
Don't you click those pincers at me!

342
00:21:39,214 --> 00:21:40,465
Not me.

343
00:21:48,974 --> 00:21:50,017
Damn it, that's hot!

344
00:21:51,226 --> 00:21:53,937
Let's see, how about here?

345
00:21:54,855 --> 00:21:56,898
What's this?

346
00:21:56,982 --> 00:21:59,484
Who the hell parked like this?

347
00:22:04,656 --> 00:22:06,241
Oh, come on.

348
00:22:10,329 --> 00:22:13,749
Why is everything
in my life so difficult these days?

349
00:22:21,506 --> 00:22:24,176
Aren't you the guy
from the convenience store?

350
00:22:24,259 --> 00:22:27,471
Oh, hello. How did you remember?

351
00:22:27,554 --> 00:22:30,891
<i>It'd be hard to forget anybody who looks
as good as you do.</i>

352
00:22:30,974 --> 00:22:32,976
I'm good at remembering people's faces.

353
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:35,854
Anyway, I'm in a bit of a hurry right now.

354
00:22:37,105 --> 00:22:38,732
Call me.

355
00:22:39,483 --> 00:22:41,276
<i>Please. Call me.</i>

356
00:22:41,777 --> 00:22:45,572
Team Leader Jin Young-seo
from Marine Group?

357
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:49,993
-You're Jin Young-seo?
-Yes.

358
00:22:50,077 --> 00:22:51,244
Is there a problem?

359
00:22:51,328 --> 00:22:52,954
There is a big problem.

360
00:22:53,038 --> 00:22:54,498
Ms. Fake Jin Young-seo.

361
00:22:57,834 --> 00:23:01,671
Don't you know that it's a crime
to use someone else's name and identity?

362
00:23:01,755 --> 00:23:04,257
What? What do you mean someone else's?

363
00:23:04,341 --> 00:23:05,967
Who are you anyway?

364
00:23:06,051 --> 00:23:09,221
I went on a blind date with
the real Jin Young-Seo a few days ago.

365
00:23:10,514 --> 00:23:14,684
Are you saying you're Kang Tae-moo?

366
00:23:19,439 --> 00:23:22,067
Why does my man of destiny
have to see me like this?

367
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:23,401
What?

368
00:23:24,069 --> 00:23:25,654
No, it's nothing.

369
00:23:26,613 --> 00:23:28,490
Ms. Jin.

370
00:23:28,573 --> 00:23:31,368
Who's the fake Jin Young-seo
who went on the blind date with me?

371
00:23:31,451 --> 00:23:35,872
I don't know. I hired her through
an agency to act the part.

372
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:39,167
I don't know her face or name.
She's a complete stranger.

373
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,919
A complete stranger?

374
00:23:41,503 --> 00:23:42,587
Yes.

375
00:23:46,299 --> 00:23:51,179
But the bag that the woman brought
to the date looked exactly that one.

376
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,180
What?

377
00:23:52,848 --> 00:23:54,850
There's no way.

378
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,144
Hers was Chanel,
and this is Saint Laurent.

379
00:23:57,227 --> 00:23:58,937
They're two very different bags.

380
00:23:59,020 --> 00:24:00,397
You have no clue.

381
00:24:01,314 --> 00:24:04,276
Chanel and Saint Laurent?
I thought she was a complete stranger.

382
00:24:04,359 --> 00:24:06,695
How did you know what kind of bag she had?

383
00:24:06,778 --> 00:24:07,779
Right, how did I?

384
00:24:07,863 --> 00:24:10,907
The elders in our families
will be very angry with you

385
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,868
when they realize what you've been up to.

386
00:24:13,493 --> 00:24:14,578
Are you okay with that?

387
00:24:14,661 --> 00:24:16,872
Are you going to tell them
the whole truth?

388
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:20,792
Can't you just say it didn't work out
once we saw each other again?

389
00:24:20,876 --> 00:24:22,460
And we decided not to get married?

390
00:24:25,005 --> 00:24:26,298
Then, before any of that,

391
00:24:28,216 --> 00:24:29,509
bring her here first.

392
00:24:29,593 --> 00:24:30,635
Who?

393
00:24:30,719 --> 00:24:31,720
The woman

394
00:24:32,721 --> 00:24:34,389
who I almost married.

395
00:24:35,390 --> 00:24:37,767
Why isn't she responding to her texts?

396
00:24:43,064 --> 00:24:45,859
<i>Yep, it's all good now. Don't worry.</i>

397
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:48,945
What a relief.

398
00:24:49,946 --> 00:24:54,492
This is driving me crazy.
What do you expect me to do?

399
00:25:03,501 --> 00:25:04,711
JOY ART ACADEMY

400
00:25:06,338 --> 00:25:09,841
Here's the bud,
and right here are the leaves.

401
00:25:09,925 --> 00:25:14,179
Oh, it's fine. I scribbled more
than he did anyway. Here you go.

402
00:25:14,262 --> 00:25:16,431
That woman was Jin Young-seo, huh?

403
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:26,149
You're back?

404
00:25:26,233 --> 00:25:28,610
Please leave my house alone.

405
00:25:29,444 --> 00:25:30,862
How can I leave it alone?

406
00:25:32,239 --> 00:25:34,366
Why do you always leave such
a mess, Sung-hoon?

407
00:25:38,703 --> 00:25:40,830
-Did you buy what I asked for?
-Here.

408
00:25:42,123 --> 00:25:43,333
And let me tell you again.

409
00:25:43,416 --> 00:25:46,586
It's not a mess. I just have my own way
of organizing things.

410
00:25:46,670 --> 00:25:47,921
Unpack them.

411
00:26:24,708 --> 00:26:26,793
Now that you've cleaned and cooked,

412
00:26:26,876 --> 00:26:28,753
-do you feel less stressed?
-Yeah.

413
00:26:28,837 --> 00:26:31,589
You sure have a weird way of de-stressing.

414
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:33,300
How is it weird?

415
00:26:33,383 --> 00:26:36,511
I put in time and effort,
and the result reflects that.

416
00:26:36,594 --> 00:26:37,887
It's productive.

417
00:26:37,971 --> 00:26:42,058
Anyway, since the Jin Young-seo
who came to the blind date was a fake,

418
00:26:42,142 --> 00:26:43,685
I guess the marriage is off.

419
00:26:43,768 --> 00:26:45,145
Why would that make any sense?

420
00:26:45,228 --> 00:26:48,440
She dared to waste my time
and made me say all those things.

421
00:26:48,523 --> 00:26:52,402
I guess the last thing Ms. Jin wanted
was to be in an arranged marriage, too.

422
00:26:52,485 --> 00:26:54,487
It's not something to be so mad about.

423
00:26:54,571 --> 00:26:56,990
I'm talking about the fake Ms. Jin,
not the real one.

424
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,076
She was just a replacement and said what?

425
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:02,579
Cheesy? An archaeopteryx?

426
00:27:04,748 --> 00:27:07,375
That's a weird direction
you're taking with your anger.

427
00:27:07,459 --> 00:27:09,085
I can't forgive her.

428
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:12,213
I'll have my revenge soon enough.

429
00:27:28,938 --> 00:27:32,150
When did you get here?

430
00:27:32,233 --> 00:27:33,443
Just now.

431
00:27:34,861 --> 00:27:38,615
Hey, did President Kang
get mad at you for trying to fool him?

432
00:27:38,698 --> 00:27:39,532
What?

433
00:27:39,616 --> 00:27:42,952
It's just, there was a rumor at work
that he's a really scary guy.

434
00:27:43,036 --> 00:27:44,829
He fired executives who betrayed him.

435
00:27:44,913 --> 00:27:47,332
Let's stop talking
about what's already over.

436
00:27:47,415 --> 00:27:50,168
Why don't we blow off some stress
and go out somewhere?

437
00:27:51,669 --> 00:27:52,837
Where?

438
00:27:53,713 --> 00:27:56,716
Go ahead and try on anything you want.

439
00:27:58,927 --> 00:27:59,886
That one?

440
00:28:01,012 --> 00:28:01,930
Next.

441
00:28:04,641 --> 00:28:06,393
I think this one looks the best!

442
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,145
What's gotten into you?
Buying me all these clothes?

443
00:28:09,229 --> 00:28:12,232
I know that you've been stressed
these days because of me.

444
00:28:12,315 --> 00:28:15,568
I'm getting all pampered for going out
on one little blind date for you?

445
00:28:20,615 --> 00:28:21,491
Wait, are you--

446
00:28:21,574 --> 00:28:23,410
Am I what?

447
00:28:23,493 --> 00:28:26,037
Don't ask me to go on
another blind date for you.

448
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:29,457
I'm not going to do it ever again!

449
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:32,210
Don't worry, I won't ever ask again.

450
00:28:33,753 --> 00:28:36,172
Make her look nice, please!
Make her shine!

451
00:28:39,300 --> 00:28:41,094
-Hey.
-Yeah.

452
00:28:41,719 --> 00:28:42,679
Say cheese!

453
00:28:42,762 --> 00:28:43,596
Let's do this!

454
00:28:46,474 --> 00:28:49,602
Are you sure that beauty salon is really
the one celebrities use?

455
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:51,229
Look at how intense my makeup is.

456
00:28:52,647 --> 00:28:55,066
That's because I asked them
to do it like that.

457
00:28:55,650 --> 00:28:56,985
What's that supposed to mean?

458
00:28:59,070 --> 00:29:01,656
Ha-ri. Listen to me carefully.

459
00:29:02,157 --> 00:29:04,617
-President Kang will be here soon.
-What? Who's coming?

460
00:29:05,118 --> 00:29:06,661
I didn't have a choice!

461
00:29:06,745 --> 00:29:09,539
He realized we were friends
and asked to meet you.

462
00:29:09,622 --> 00:29:11,708
Then you should've
pretended not to know me!

463
00:29:11,791 --> 00:29:13,877
But then he said he'd find out on his own!

464
00:29:13,960 --> 00:29:16,588
What if he finds out you're his employee?

465
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,798
You could've at least warned me.

466
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:20,925
Then you wouldn't have come here.

467
00:29:21,009 --> 00:29:23,803
Anyway, he thinks you owe him an apology.

468
00:29:23,887 --> 00:29:25,513
-Just say you're sorry.
-What?

469
00:29:25,597 --> 00:29:28,224
What's the worst that can happen?
Okay, I'm going now.

470
00:29:28,308 --> 00:29:30,059
-You're leaving?
-Oh, right!

471
00:29:31,561 --> 00:29:33,980
Don't forget and be sure to wear the wig.

472
00:29:34,063 --> 00:29:35,565
-A wig?
-Sorry.

473
00:29:35,648 --> 00:29:38,526
-I'm sorry!
-Wait, Young-seo!

474
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,611
Young-seo!

475
00:29:39,694 --> 00:29:42,697
I knew I had a bad feeling about this!

476
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:43,740
Damn it.

477
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,247
Hold on!

478
00:29:51,331 --> 00:29:52,874
What do I do?

479
00:29:52,957 --> 00:29:54,667
I don't know!

480
00:29:57,921 --> 00:29:58,922
Oh, damn it.

481
00:30:01,841 --> 00:30:05,011
Why did this have to spill right now?

482
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:12,685
Oh, thank you.

483
00:30:13,228 --> 00:30:14,354
Oh, my.

484
00:30:16,564 --> 00:30:19,234
We meet again, Ms. Fake Jin Young-seo.

485
00:30:34,457 --> 00:30:36,084
You work at a fried chicken shop?

486
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:37,669
What?

487
00:30:39,045 --> 00:30:40,797
Oh, that.

488
00:30:42,215 --> 00:30:43,550
I can just call and check.

489
00:30:43,633 --> 00:30:47,637
My family runs a fried chicken… shop, yes.

490
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,306
<i>Damn it, I told him where I live, too.</i>

491
00:30:52,100 --> 00:30:53,184
How much?

492
00:30:53,268 --> 00:30:56,396
Plain fried chicken is 15,000 won
and the spicy one is 17,000 won.

493
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:57,605
I wasn't talking about--

494
00:30:59,148 --> 00:31:00,233
About the chicken.

495
00:31:01,568 --> 00:31:04,153
How much did you get paid
to impersonate Jin Young-seo?

496
00:31:07,365 --> 00:31:08,408
That's…

497
00:31:09,075 --> 00:31:09,951
So…

498
00:31:10,034 --> 00:31:12,036
Just lay it out honestly.

499
00:31:14,247 --> 00:31:18,418
I kept on telling her I couldn't do it,
that I really couldn't do it,

500
00:31:18,501 --> 00:31:22,547
but then she just kept telling me
she would pay me 800,000 won.

501
00:31:22,630 --> 00:31:25,008
So, that's how it all happened.

502
00:31:25,091 --> 00:31:29,262
You tried to scam me
for merely 800,000 won?

503
00:31:30,972 --> 00:31:33,600
Going as a replacement
isn't technically a scam, is it?

504
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:35,476
You pretended to be another person.

505
00:31:35,560 --> 00:31:38,897
You deliberately wasted someone's
precious time for your own benefit.

506
00:31:38,980 --> 00:31:40,773
If that's not a scam, what is it?

507
00:31:42,692 --> 00:31:44,027
I'm sorry.

508
00:31:44,527 --> 00:31:46,029
I urgently needed some money,

509
00:31:46,112 --> 00:31:49,282
and it wasn't an amount that I could
handle with my monthly paycheck.

510
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:54,746
I thought you were just a regular
old scammer, but you have a job, too?

511
00:31:54,829 --> 00:31:56,789
You've got some skills, yeah?

512
00:31:56,873 --> 00:32:01,586
Oh, I mean it's just
a small, medium-sized company.

513
00:32:01,669 --> 00:32:03,588
Yeah, real small…

514
00:32:04,505 --> 00:32:08,384
<i>And that company is actually yours.</i>

515
00:32:11,554 --> 00:32:14,349
I wonder if he brought that
handsome secretary along again.

516
00:32:17,727 --> 00:32:20,188
No. This is no time to think about men

517
00:32:20,271 --> 00:32:22,523
when you've just thrown your friend
to the wolves.

518
00:32:24,859 --> 00:32:26,986
I'm sorry, dear friend.

519
00:32:32,408 --> 00:32:35,954
Anyway, he thinks you owe him an apology.
Just say you're sorry.

520
00:32:36,871 --> 00:32:38,706
<i>I didn't do anything wrong</i>

521
00:32:38,790 --> 00:32:41,250
<i>besides hiding the fact
that I'm an employee of his.</i>

522
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:50,677
<i>But it'd be my loss if he finds out
who I am just because I made him mad.</i>

523
00:32:52,845 --> 00:32:55,014
I know that a simple apology
won't be enough.

524
00:32:55,598 --> 00:32:57,058
I wish I could make it up to you

525
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:00,144
for all of the time you wasted
and for your hurt feelings,

526
00:33:00,228 --> 00:33:02,021
but there isn't a way to do that.

527
00:33:02,105 --> 00:33:04,774
And it's not like I can pay you back
in money or gifts,

528
00:33:04,857 --> 00:33:07,276
as you already have so
much more than I do.

529
00:33:08,277 --> 00:33:11,823
What I can do is promise that I'll do
everything in my power to help you out

530
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:13,700
if you ever need a favor.

531
00:33:18,037 --> 00:33:19,747
Are you still mad?

532
00:33:24,752 --> 00:33:26,254
In what way,

533
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:29,215
do I look like an archaeopteryx?

534
00:33:30,842 --> 00:33:31,926
Sorry?

535
00:33:33,469 --> 00:33:36,347
Oh, is that why you're angry?

536
00:33:36,431 --> 00:33:38,099
It's not that I'm angry,

537
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:41,519
it's just that I've never heard
such nonsense before,

538
00:33:41,602 --> 00:33:43,938
so I was caught off-guard, yes.

539
00:33:44,022 --> 00:33:45,773
Oh, that.

540
00:33:45,857 --> 00:33:49,152
I just said whatever popped into my head

541
00:33:49,235 --> 00:33:51,779
because I wanted you
to stop asking me to marry you.

542
00:33:51,863 --> 00:33:53,406
Whatever popped into your head?

543
00:33:54,490 --> 00:33:56,242
But the resemblance is there.

544
00:33:56,325 --> 00:33:58,911
Your small face, your sharp eyes,
and your lanky limbs.

545
00:33:59,495 --> 00:34:01,164
No one has ever told you that?

546
00:34:01,247 --> 00:34:03,916
Didn't I just tell you
that I've never heard it before?

547
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:05,418
Oh, right.

548
00:34:06,252 --> 00:34:07,420
I'm sorry.

549
00:34:08,421 --> 00:34:11,174
<i>That's really why he got so angry?</i>

550
00:34:11,257 --> 00:34:13,676
<i>Wow, hold a grudge much?</i>

551
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:14,886
Well,

552
00:34:14,969 --> 00:34:17,013
if there's not much else for us
to talk about,

553
00:34:17,096 --> 00:34:19,515
would it be okay
if we wrapped things up about now?

554
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:24,604
We're still looking for part-timers
at my family's chicken shop,

555
00:34:24,687 --> 00:34:26,606
so I help out in the evenings.

556
00:34:26,689 --> 00:34:29,067
I think it'll be best for me
to get going--

557
00:34:30,026 --> 00:34:32,070
INCOMING CALL
DON'T ANSWER

558
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:38,284
Save my name again.
And pick up when I call from now on.

559
00:34:38,367 --> 00:34:40,745
If you don't answer my calls,
or try to disappear…

560
00:34:42,997 --> 00:34:44,582
I will come and find you.

561
00:34:48,503 --> 00:34:49,462
Okay.

562
00:34:52,215 --> 00:34:54,884
Also, what's your actual name?

563
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:56,511
My name?

564
00:34:56,594 --> 00:34:57,970
Shin Ha--

565
00:34:59,388 --> 00:35:02,350
<i>If I give him my real name,
he might recognize me later on.</i>

566
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:05,728
Geum… hui.

567
00:35:05,812 --> 00:35:07,313
Geum-hui.

568
00:35:08,564 --> 00:35:10,942
SHIN GEUM-HUI

569
00:35:12,735 --> 00:35:14,779
Archaeopteryx.

570
00:35:14,862 --> 00:35:19,158
I wonder if Ms. Geum-hui
can manage a smile today?

571
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,249
I'll have the cheese pork cutlet.

572
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,333
Yes, sir.

573
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:31,462
What kind of rich folks would meet up
at a pork cutlet franchise

574
00:35:31,546 --> 00:35:33,506
to see all their in-laws?

575
00:35:35,675 --> 00:35:37,218
Either way, I'm still jealous.

576
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:41,764
It'd be nice to meet some in-laws
at a pork cutlet restaurant.

577
00:35:42,723 --> 00:35:43,683
I'm home.

578
00:35:43,766 --> 00:35:45,643
You're just getting back?

579
00:35:45,726 --> 00:35:48,437
Everything went well with Ms. Jin?

580
00:35:49,021 --> 00:35:50,690
So what about the wedding?

581
00:35:50,773 --> 00:35:53,109
Both of our families should
meet first, right?

582
00:35:53,192 --> 00:35:55,736
I decided not to marry Ms. Jin Young-seo.

583
00:35:55,820 --> 00:35:58,030
What? What do you--

584
00:35:58,614 --> 00:36:02,827
Well, that's what happened,
so please don't bring her up anymore.

585
00:36:05,288 --> 00:36:06,789
That little--

586
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:08,416
<i>I can't agree to this marriage.</i>

587
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:12,003
<i>No, I won't agree.</i>

588
00:36:12,879 --> 00:36:15,381
The person I really love is Geum-hui.

589
00:36:16,132 --> 00:36:17,466
-Shin Geum-hui.
-Gwang-bok!

590
00:36:18,509 --> 00:36:23,848
You dare insult my daughter all because
of some girl from the fried chicken shop?

591
00:36:29,061 --> 00:36:33,274
That must have hurt. I bet the crust
on that cutlet was really crispy.

592
00:36:33,858 --> 00:36:38,362
Anyway, whether it's in real life
or on television,

593
00:36:38,446 --> 00:36:42,617
why is it so hard to get married,
these days?

594
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,538
Shin Geum-hui.

595
00:36:47,622 --> 00:36:49,874
<i>BE STRONG, GEUM-HUI</i>

596
00:36:49,957 --> 00:36:53,085
Shin Geum-hui.

597
00:36:53,169 --> 00:36:57,131
Why did I suddenly think of that name?

598
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:59,884
I feel like I've heard it somewhere.
Shin Geum-hui.

599
00:36:59,967 --> 00:37:01,636
<i>Your call has been forwarded to voicemail…</i>

600
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:03,971
Wow, she's turned her phone off, huh?

601
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:07,141
You just wait until I find you,
Young-seo. I will destroy you.

602
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,317
Ha-ri, you're back!

603
00:37:17,068 --> 00:37:18,778
Jin Young-seo!

604
00:37:18,861 --> 00:37:20,279
Calm down.

605
00:37:20,363 --> 00:37:23,157
You! You're a really bad person!

606
00:37:23,824 --> 00:37:24,951
Hey, what are you doing?

607
00:37:26,786 --> 00:37:28,329
Please!

608
00:37:30,164 --> 00:37:32,166
I'm sorry.

609
00:37:32,667 --> 00:37:34,710
I didn't know my phone was turned off.

610
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:37,046
I swear I wasn't ignoring you
on purpose, really.

611
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:38,464
Save it!

612
00:37:39,006 --> 00:37:41,759
Good thing I was quick
and gave him a fake name.

613
00:37:42,343 --> 00:37:45,179
Or else, he could've fired me
then and there!

614
00:37:45,263 --> 00:37:47,139
What were you thinking, taking me there?

615
00:37:47,765 --> 00:37:49,517
I'm really sorry.

616
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,727
You saw him, how charismatic he can be!

617
00:37:51,811 --> 00:37:54,063
I didn't have a choice.

618
00:37:54,146 --> 00:37:56,899
At least he doesn't know
that you're his employee so--

619
00:37:56,983 --> 00:37:59,652
But he found out that my family
runs a fried chicken shop!

620
00:37:59,735 --> 00:38:01,529
What? Wait, how?

621
00:38:01,612 --> 00:38:05,032
I felt bad about skipping the birthday
party that my coworkers threw for me,

622
00:38:05,116 --> 00:38:07,743
so I was bringing some coupons
and dropped them.

623
00:38:07,827 --> 00:38:11,664
Why would you bring those coupons
with you? You thoughtless idiot!

624
00:38:11,747 --> 00:38:13,916
You have no right to be yelling
at me like that!

625
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,960
It's all your fault!

626
00:38:16,043 --> 00:38:17,670
Wearing this apron isn't going to--

627
00:38:17,753 --> 00:38:18,671
Ha-ri!

628
00:38:19,630 --> 00:38:22,591
What are you doing? Why are you grabbing
Young-seo by the collar?

629
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,927
-No, this is--
-I'm all right, Mrs. Han.

630
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:27,096
Also, don't scold Ha-ri, please.

631
00:38:27,179 --> 00:38:29,098
It's all my fault, and I deserve it.

632
00:38:29,181 --> 00:38:30,975
I mean, how bad could it have been?

633
00:38:31,058 --> 00:38:33,519
You can't grab your friend
by the collar like this!

634
00:38:33,602 --> 00:38:35,313
You and your temper! Let go now!

635
00:38:35,396 --> 00:38:37,440
-Let go of her, come on!
-What?

636
00:38:37,940 --> 00:38:40,067
Mom, you don't know anything!

637
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:44,155
If you like Young-seo so much, why don't
you just raise her instead of me?

638
00:38:44,238 --> 00:38:46,365
-I mean, really--
-Look at that temper.

639
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,867
Why do you have to be so mean?

640
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,120
Mrs. Han! It's all my fault, I'm sorry!

641
00:38:51,203 --> 00:38:53,706
-Wow, look at you.
-What?

642
00:38:53,789 --> 00:38:55,708
Both of you, stop!

643
00:39:00,588 --> 00:39:06,093
Who did she get that hot temper
from, anyway? Really!

644
00:39:06,177 --> 00:39:08,596
Does she really not know
who she gets it from?

645
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,057
Why can't she get along with her friend?

646
00:39:11,140 --> 00:39:14,060
You should count yourself lucky
Young-seo stays by your side.

647
00:39:14,143 --> 00:39:16,771
If I had a daughter like Young-seo,
I'd be so happy!

648
00:39:16,854 --> 00:39:17,813
I know, right?

649
00:39:17,897 --> 00:39:21,484
Mom, don't you wish that
you had a daughter like Young-seo?

650
00:39:21,567 --> 00:39:22,818
Do you want me to seduce her?

651
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:25,071
To have a "daughter"-in-law. It'd be nice.

652
00:39:25,571 --> 00:39:28,240
Even if you tried,
you think that would work?

653
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,117
What do you mean, a "daughter"-in-law?

654
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,912
It's just a daughter-in-law!
Just fold your laundry.

655
00:39:34,246 --> 00:39:38,209
<i>You should take this chance
to buy this kimchi product.</i>

656
00:39:38,292 --> 00:39:39,668
This early in the morning?

657
00:39:39,752 --> 00:39:41,837
I told them to mind the scheduling.

658
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,340
<i>Call to place--</i>

659
00:39:44,423 --> 00:39:48,260
<i>The archaeopteryx is considered
to be the ancestor of all modern birds.</i>

660
00:39:49,178 --> 00:39:53,599
<i>Fossil samples were discovered
in limestone in Solnhofen, Bavaria.</i>

661
00:39:54,683 --> 00:39:56,602
<i>The archaeopteryx lived at the end</i>

662
00:39:56,685 --> 00:39:59,772
<i>of the Jurassic period, in the southern
part of modern-day Germany.</i>

663
00:40:00,940 --> 00:40:02,650
Freaking Jurassic, damn it.

664
00:40:02,733 --> 00:40:07,696
<i>You can see that the length of the body
is about 30 to 50 centimeters long,</i>

665
00:40:07,780 --> 00:40:09,490
<i>which is about the size of a raven.</i>

666
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,826
<i>This was a bird with a small head
and large eyes…</i>

667
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:27,299
Hello?

668
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,760
Ms. Geum-hui?

669
00:40:30,719 --> 00:40:32,847
What's he saying?

670
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:35,516
Why is anyone prank calling at this hour?

671
00:40:35,599 --> 00:40:38,727
It's not a prank call.
Are you still half-asleep? Ms. Geum-hui.

672
00:40:38,811 --> 00:40:40,271
I'm not Geum--

673
00:40:47,862 --> 00:40:50,448
Sorry, you just surprised me.

674
00:40:50,531 --> 00:40:51,866
Why did you call?

675
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:53,367
I just called to make sure

676
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,078
you didn't get a new number
to cut me off. That's all.

677
00:40:56,162 --> 00:40:57,413
Okay.

678
00:40:58,080 --> 00:40:58,956
Hello?

679
00:41:00,916 --> 00:41:01,876
What?

680
00:41:02,543 --> 00:41:04,753
It's four in the morning.
Has he lost his mind?

681
00:41:04,837 --> 00:41:08,048
What the heck? I'm totally awake now.
Is he insane?

682
00:41:08,132 --> 00:41:10,468
This guy is so annoying! Really!

683
00:41:11,010 --> 00:41:12,511
He's so annoying.

684
00:41:14,513 --> 00:41:17,099
<i>Here, you can observe its teeth.</i>

685
00:41:17,892 --> 00:41:19,226
An archaeopteryx?

686
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:20,436
<i>There are three-clawed…</i>

687
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:22,897
I hope she gets a terrible night's sleep.

688
00:41:22,980 --> 00:41:25,524
<i>On the tail, there are 20 to 21 tail--</i>

689
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,447
Why are you yawning
first thing in the morning?

690
00:41:31,530 --> 00:41:33,032
You didn't sleep well?

691
00:41:33,115 --> 00:41:36,702
I just had trouble going back
to sleep in the middle of the night.

692
00:41:37,286 --> 00:41:38,454
Okay.

693
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:42,875
Did you all hear? You haven't, right?

694
00:41:42,958 --> 00:41:44,877
Again, I'm the only one
who's heard, right?

695
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,337
Okay. Focus, everyone.

696
00:41:46,420 --> 00:41:48,923
Apparently, President Kang
went on a blind date.

697
00:41:50,257 --> 00:41:53,761
Jeez, what's the big deal?
It has nothing to do with us.

698
00:41:53,844 --> 00:41:57,056
There you go again.
You have to see the big picture here.

699
00:41:57,139 --> 00:41:59,475
It has everything to do with us!

700
00:41:59,558 --> 00:42:01,435
Rich people will always stick together.

701
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:02,853
There might be a merger.

702
00:42:02,937 --> 00:42:05,856
That'll have a huge impact
on stock prices.

703
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,692
You barely have a few dozen shares
of the company stock.

704
00:42:08,776 --> 00:42:12,238
Why are you making such a big deal of it
as if you're some major shareholder?

705
00:42:13,072 --> 00:42:16,367
I have a grand total of 50 shares.

706
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:17,868
That all adds up, you know?

707
00:42:23,666 --> 00:42:27,586
Anyway, stop talking about President Kang.

708
00:42:27,670 --> 00:42:29,463
He may be the president of our company,

709
00:42:29,547 --> 00:42:32,258
but he's someone we might never run into.

710
00:42:32,341 --> 00:42:34,510
Are you a pro-wrestler?
How are you so strong?

711
00:42:34,593 --> 00:42:35,970
<i>Right?</i>

712
00:42:36,595 --> 00:42:40,808
<i>Please, help me so I never have
to run into that man, dear Buddha.</i>

713
00:42:40,891 --> 00:42:41,976
<i>Dear God.</i>

714
00:42:48,065 --> 00:42:48,941
You asked for me?

715
00:42:49,024 --> 00:42:51,110
Yes. With the factory in Ilsan,

716
00:42:51,193 --> 00:42:53,946
when are we planning to restart
the second production line?

717
00:42:54,029 --> 00:42:57,575
They said it would take at least a week
to finish all of the replacement work.

718
00:42:57,658 --> 00:43:00,244
And today's the first day at work
for Mr. Hwang, right?

719
00:43:00,327 --> 00:43:03,038
Mr. Park's replacement?
Let's have lunch with him today.

720
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:06,083
Actually, your schedule has changed
starting from lunch today.

721
00:43:06,166 --> 00:43:09,169
What? What do you mean?
Without so much as a word to me?

722
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:11,755
The order came from the chairman himself.

723
00:43:11,839 --> 00:43:13,716
I'm scheduling the dates for you again.

724
00:43:13,799 --> 00:43:14,800
What?

725
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,179
So that's how it's going to be, huh?

726
00:43:19,888 --> 00:43:21,765
Han Min-hui. Daemang Industries.

727
00:43:21,849 --> 00:43:24,268
She majored in piano
at the Juilliard School of Music,

728
00:43:24,351 --> 00:43:26,812
and she's currently working toward
a doctorate at Seoul National University.

729
00:43:26,895 --> 00:43:28,772
<i>People say it's a shame</i>

730
00:43:28,856 --> 00:43:30,774
that I have to get married
with this career.

731
00:43:30,858 --> 00:43:35,654
But I think bringing a child
that has my good genetics into this world

732
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:37,573
and raising it is also worthwhile.

733
00:43:37,656 --> 00:43:40,576
<i>The second daughter of the Minister of
Justice. Graduate of Harvard Med School.</i>

734
00:43:40,659 --> 00:43:43,120
<i>Seeing as she's from Harvard too,
you two should have a lot in common.</i>

735
00:43:43,203 --> 00:43:45,080
You know Professor Albert, right?

736
00:43:45,164 --> 00:43:47,541
Yes, he was my advisor.

737
00:43:47,625 --> 00:43:50,419
He taught a business course
that I took as an elective,

738
00:43:50,502 --> 00:43:52,880
and I remember him speaking
very highly of you.

739
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,799
Your senior thesis…

740
00:43:58,719 --> 00:44:02,931
-Mr. Kang? I've heard a lot about you.
-You're even better looking than I heard.

741
00:44:03,015 --> 00:44:04,350
And you're so tall.

742
00:44:04,433 --> 00:44:06,226
I love how you look so calm.

743
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:07,728
-You're my type.
-You're my type.

744
00:44:07,811 --> 00:44:09,688
When I told my family about you…

745
00:44:09,772 --> 00:44:11,315
All the elders were thrilled.

746
00:44:11,398 --> 00:44:13,651
This is the first time
I've felt like this, so…

747
00:44:13,734 --> 00:44:14,860
-my heart is fluttering.
-My heart is fluttering.

748
00:44:15,569 --> 00:44:17,696
Oh, look at me rambling on.

749
00:44:21,533 --> 00:44:25,287
Do you think there's any other person
who goes on ten blind dates in a day?

750
00:44:25,371 --> 00:44:26,872
Probably not.

751
00:44:27,539 --> 00:44:31,377
You'll set a new record for the most blind
dates in the shortest amount of time.

752
00:44:34,546 --> 00:44:36,965
You hit the wrong button.
Why did you press the roof?

753
00:44:37,049 --> 00:44:38,509
I didn't press the wrong one.

754
00:44:39,468 --> 00:44:40,844
It's not over yet.

755
00:44:40,928 --> 00:44:42,137
What?

756
00:44:42,221 --> 00:44:44,556
Her name is Yoko Hitori,
and her Korean name is Oh Eun-ji.

757
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:47,309
A third-generation immigrant,
and the second-in-line for Hitori Foods.

758
00:44:57,277 --> 00:45:00,280
Did any of the ladies today
catch your eye?

759
00:45:00,364 --> 00:45:01,907
-Not at all.
-What?

760
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,202
They all seemed a lot better
than the fake Jin Young-seo,

761
00:45:05,285 --> 00:45:07,162
who you decided to marry at first glance.

762
00:45:07,246 --> 00:45:09,665
At least the fake Jin Young-seo
wasn't boring.

763
00:45:09,748 --> 00:45:12,126
How can they all say
the exact same things?

764
00:45:12,709 --> 00:45:14,086
That is true.

765
00:45:14,169 --> 00:45:16,713
She sure was different from the others.

766
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:21,009
President Kang, your nose is bleeding.

767
00:45:21,093 --> 00:45:22,886
My nose is bleeding?

768
00:45:22,970 --> 00:45:24,680
Damn it.

769
00:45:26,306 --> 00:45:28,308
Stupid nosebleeds.

770
00:45:31,812 --> 00:45:33,105
You're late.

771
00:45:33,689 --> 00:45:35,357
How were the blind dates?

772
00:45:36,358 --> 00:45:37,901
Don't you think this is a bit much?

773
00:45:37,985 --> 00:45:41,029
Do you have any idea
how many blind dates I just went on?

774
00:45:41,113 --> 00:45:45,200
You went over to Japan
to make it to number 11.

775
00:45:45,284 --> 00:45:49,872
How was today? Did you like
any of the ladies you met today?

776
00:45:49,955 --> 00:45:51,373
I can't believe you.

777
00:45:51,457 --> 00:45:52,833
Stop overreacting.

778
00:45:54,251 --> 00:45:59,465
You're the one who got me all excited,
saying you would marry Jin Young-seo.

779
00:46:00,048 --> 00:46:01,758
And then, what? You call it off?

780
00:46:02,259 --> 00:46:04,887
-Are you toying with your grandfather?
-That's not it.

781
00:46:04,970 --> 00:46:07,181
Stop making excuses and keep your promise!

782
00:46:14,271 --> 00:46:17,774
Meet the rest tomorrow, up to number 20.

783
00:46:17,858 --> 00:46:20,360
And if there's still no lady
that you like,

784
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:24,990
I'll find a year's worth of eligible women
you can go on dates with.

785
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,995
LIST OF BLIND DATE CANDIDATES

786
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,749
I have a woman who I want to marry.

787
00:46:35,667 --> 00:46:36,502
What?

788
00:46:36,585 --> 00:46:38,629
You have someone you want to marry?

789
00:46:38,712 --> 00:46:39,671
Yes.

790
00:46:39,755 --> 00:46:42,883
You're always buried in your work.
When did you have the time--

791
00:46:42,966 --> 00:46:46,220
No matter how busy I am,
I still have the time to meet women.

792
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:49,431
You should've said that
from the beginning.

793
00:46:49,515 --> 00:46:51,558
Then why did you go on
all those blind dates?

794
00:46:51,642 --> 00:46:55,729
And why would you say all that nonsense
about marrying Ms. Young-seo?

795
00:46:55,812 --> 00:46:59,066
The truth is, we broke up for a little bit
because we had a fight.

796
00:46:59,149 --> 00:47:00,567
So I did it out of anger.

797
00:47:04,279 --> 00:47:05,572
Is he telling the truth?

798
00:47:06,198 --> 00:47:08,325
You should thank Mr. Cha.

799
00:47:08,408 --> 00:47:10,619
He's the reason we made up
and got back together.

800
00:47:15,207 --> 00:47:17,334
Yes, sir. I tried very hard.

801
00:47:19,169 --> 00:47:20,879
So when will you introduce her to me?

802
00:47:20,963 --> 00:47:23,173
I'll set up a meeting in the near future.

803
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:24,591
Set a date immediately.

804
00:47:24,675 --> 00:47:26,468
I need to ask her when she's available.

805
00:47:27,761 --> 00:47:31,014
That means no more blind dates
for me, right?

806
00:47:31,598 --> 00:47:32,849
Sure.

807
00:47:32,933 --> 00:47:35,018
If you had told me beforehand,

808
00:47:35,102 --> 00:47:38,230
I wouldn't have set up
such an overwhelming schedule like today.

809
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:40,232
So you're aware that it was overwhelming?

810
00:47:41,316 --> 00:47:43,652
All right, do what you need to do.

811
00:47:43,735 --> 00:47:44,903
I'll be going now.

812
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,409
Be good.

813
00:48:02,254 --> 00:48:03,422
President Kang?

814
00:48:03,505 --> 00:48:05,257
How could you tell that kind of lie

815
00:48:05,340 --> 00:48:07,593
when you don't have
a woman you're marrying?

816
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,303
How will you get out of this one?

817
00:48:09,386 --> 00:48:10,304
What do you think?

818
00:48:11,138 --> 00:48:14,766
I'm going to tell the person in charge
to take responsibility.

819
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:16,268
INCOMING CALL
ARCHAEOPTERYX

820
00:48:18,353 --> 00:48:21,481
What is this? I already apologized
and settled the whole thing.

821
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,275
So annoying.

822
00:48:26,111 --> 00:48:28,905
-Hello?
-Let's meet after you get off of work.

823
00:48:28,989 --> 00:48:30,657
What? Why?

824
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:32,075
I'm busy.

825
00:48:32,159 --> 00:48:34,411
-Should I go to your house, then?
-What? No!

826
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:40,042
I mean, I'm going to be late today.

827
00:48:40,125 --> 00:48:42,961
I'm working overtime, so I'll be at work.

828
00:48:46,673 --> 00:48:48,258
Where do you work, Ms. Shin?

829
00:48:48,342 --> 00:48:50,218
Where do I work?

830
00:48:51,136 --> 00:48:53,221
It's pretty far from Seoul, actually.

831
00:48:53,305 --> 00:48:55,807
Far, where? I even went to Japan today.

832
00:48:55,891 --> 00:48:57,309
Is it farther than Japan?

833
00:48:58,143 --> 00:48:59,102
What?

834
00:49:01,396 --> 00:49:02,898
<i>What? Ilsan?</i>

835
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:04,816
<i>Why Ilsan all of a sudden?</i>

836
00:49:04,900 --> 00:49:07,235
I don't know. The words popped out.

837
00:49:07,319 --> 00:49:09,696
<i>Wow, seriously?
So what are you going to do?</i>

838
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:12,908
I'm meeting him
at some coffee shop near the subway.

839
00:49:12,991 --> 00:49:15,327
I'm actually almost there.
I'll call you later. Bye!

840
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,039
What? He's already there?

841
00:49:22,042 --> 00:49:22,918
Hello?

842
00:49:23,001 --> 00:49:26,505
<i>I'm at the coffee shop.
Are you sure you're a regular, here?</i>

843
00:49:26,588 --> 00:49:29,549
-Of course, why?
-<i>Nothing. It just seems a bit strange.</i>

844
00:49:29,633 --> 00:49:31,510
Rainbow Cafe, right? That's the one.

845
00:49:31,593 --> 00:49:33,387
I had coffee there yesterday, too.

846
00:49:36,431 --> 00:49:37,307
Thank you.

847
00:49:37,391 --> 00:49:39,559
I'm here. Wait just a second.

848
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,528
Where's Rainbow Cafe?

849
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:56,535
You're really a regular here?

850
00:49:58,245 --> 00:50:01,540
Yes, I am. I really like the vibe here.

851
00:50:04,084 --> 00:50:07,003
Mom, he pushed me!

852
00:50:08,797 --> 00:50:10,966
I'm not your mom.

853
00:50:11,049 --> 00:50:12,092
I'm so sorry.

854
00:50:20,308 --> 00:50:22,269
You like this kind of vibe?

855
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:26,481
Well, sure, there's the vibe,
but the coffee is really good here.

856
00:50:31,319 --> 00:50:33,238
Could you make it quick?

857
00:50:33,321 --> 00:50:34,948
I need to head home soon.

858
00:50:35,031 --> 00:50:37,242
This isn't the place to say such things,

859
00:50:40,954 --> 00:50:43,665
but I want us to start dating.
With marriage in mind.

860
00:50:43,749 --> 00:50:44,708
What?

861
00:50:47,043 --> 00:50:51,173
Did you fall in love at first sight when
you saw me on our blind date or something?

862
00:50:51,256 --> 00:50:53,675
It wasn't my plan for that to happen.

863
00:50:53,759 --> 00:50:55,677
You're getting ahead of yourself.

864
00:50:55,761 --> 00:50:57,429
I'm not saying
that we should actually date.

865
00:50:57,512 --> 00:51:00,182
Just pretend like we are, Ms. Shin.

866
00:51:00,265 --> 00:51:01,433
What?

867
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:05,353
I won't do it. You've been calling me
a fraud and an imposter,

868
00:51:05,437 --> 00:51:08,190
and now you're asking me
to do it all over again?

869
00:51:08,273 --> 00:51:11,067
What else am I supposed to do?
You're the best person for the job.

870
00:51:11,902 --> 00:51:13,653
The best person for the job?

871
00:51:13,737 --> 00:51:15,781
You've proven your acting skills
on our date last time.

872
00:51:15,864 --> 00:51:18,909
You already know my situation,
so I don't need to explain.

873
00:51:18,992 --> 00:51:20,952
And the secret is safe with you.

874
00:51:21,036 --> 00:51:24,122
Most importantly,
you wanted to repay your debt.

875
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:26,583
Not to mention
all the precious time I'll save.

876
00:51:26,666 --> 00:51:28,668
It's a win-win situation, is it not?

877
00:51:34,549 --> 00:51:36,343
I don't care who wins what.

878
00:51:36,426 --> 00:51:38,887
I don't want to lie to other people again.

879
00:51:38,970 --> 00:51:40,555
I'll just forget
we ever had this conversation.

880
00:51:40,639 --> 00:51:42,182
You said you received 800,000 won?

881
00:51:45,602 --> 00:51:46,978
I'll double it.

882
00:51:48,897 --> 00:51:50,857
Double it?

883
00:51:54,528 --> 00:51:56,863
And that's every time
you meet with my grandfather.

884
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,534
He's a suspicious man, so it'll take
more than a couple of meetings.

885
00:52:08,458 --> 00:52:11,169
<i>When I look back
at the short life that I've led so far,</i>

886
00:52:11,795 --> 00:52:16,341
<i>I spent more time in debt
than I ever spent being happy.</i>

887
00:52:16,424 --> 00:52:17,634
Mom, Dad.

888
00:52:17,717 --> 00:52:22,222
We have nothing to say as your parents.

889
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,642
STUDENT LOANS, CREDIT CARDS,
COLLATERAL LOANS, NEGATIVE ACCOUNTS

890
00:52:30,772 --> 00:52:36,570

Bye, debt!

897
00:53:34,961 --> 00:53:37,213
Mom, Dad.

898
00:53:37,297 --> 00:53:40,091
I got into a major company!

899
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:47,933
I'm sorry, Ha-ri.

900
00:53:49,225 --> 00:53:50,769
Ha-ri.

901
00:53:52,062 --> 00:53:53,563
ECONOMIC DAILY
CHICKEN INDUSTRY IN PERIL

902
00:53:53,647 --> 00:53:54,773
EPIC FAIL

903
00:53:54,856 --> 00:53:56,983
<i>I might be able to
get rid of my debts at once.</i>

904
00:53:59,027 --> 00:54:00,487
<i>Should I just go for it?</i>

905
00:54:02,113 --> 00:54:02,948
<i>No.</i>

906
00:54:03,031 --> 00:54:06,409
<i>Money is important,
but he's the company president.</i>

907
00:54:11,081 --> 00:54:12,457
Have you made up your mind?

908
00:54:13,458 --> 00:54:15,502
I don't think I can do it. I'm sorry.

909
00:54:15,585 --> 00:54:17,087
When you were apologizing
for deceiving me,

910
00:54:17,170 --> 00:54:19,506
you said you were willing
to do anything to help me.

911
00:54:19,589 --> 00:54:21,299
Were those empty words?

912
00:54:21,383 --> 00:54:24,344
-What? No, I meant that.
-Then do this for me.

913
00:54:24,427 --> 00:54:26,846
This is the only thing
that you could help me with

914
00:54:26,930 --> 00:54:28,181
that's within your power.

915
00:54:28,765 --> 00:54:29,849
I mean…

916
00:54:35,480 --> 00:54:37,190
<i>Make sure to eat well.</i>

917
00:54:37,273 --> 00:54:38,775
Are you back, sweetie?

918
00:54:38,858 --> 00:54:40,151
Hi.

919
00:54:42,237 --> 00:54:44,072
<i>-Welcome--</i>
-This is crazy.

920
00:54:44,155 --> 00:54:45,740
<i>Shin Geum-hui!</i>

921
00:54:45,824 --> 00:54:47,117
Refreshing beer for the table!

922
00:54:47,200 --> 00:54:49,411
<i>How dare you try to take
my daughter's lover?</i>

923
00:54:50,370 --> 00:54:52,998
<i>I'm sorry. I have nothing to say--</i>

924
00:54:53,081 --> 00:54:54,582
<i>Then don't speak!</i>

925
00:54:54,666 --> 00:54:56,209
<i>Shut your mouth!</i>

926
00:54:59,295 --> 00:55:01,506
<i>You have no shame.</i>

927
00:55:01,589 --> 00:55:05,635
Oh, my. Last week Gwang-bok was
getting slapped with a pork cutlet,

928
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:08,722
and this week, Geum-hui's getting
slapped with a chicken leg?

929
00:55:10,724 --> 00:55:13,435
How could she do that to such a nice girl?

930
00:55:14,144 --> 00:55:17,230
You think a rich family would
ever accept a girl like Geum-hui?

931
00:55:17,313 --> 00:55:19,983
Her family just runs
a local fried chicken shop.

932
00:55:20,942 --> 00:55:22,235
Oh, my gosh.

933
00:55:22,318 --> 00:55:23,737
What's wrong with that?

934
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,322
I didn't mean Ha-ri.
We're talking about the TV show.

935
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,409
All those rubbish TV shows need to go
off the air, you hear?

936
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:33,079
The love story where a poor girl
falls in love with a superrich guy?

937
00:55:33,163 --> 00:55:34,581
It's not realistic at all.

938
00:55:35,331 --> 00:55:39,169
<i>Mom. That unrealistic love story</i>

939
00:55:39,252 --> 00:55:41,087
<i>is happening to me right now.</i>

940
00:55:41,629 --> 00:55:45,216
What? Is it that bastard Tae-moo again?

941
00:55:54,392 --> 00:55:55,894
Hi, Min-woo.

942
00:55:55,977 --> 00:55:58,855
Hey, I'm going to forget your face.
Why haven't you stopped by?

943
00:55:59,564 --> 00:56:01,733
I've been a bit busy at work.

944
00:56:02,400 --> 00:56:05,195
What's wrong with your voice?
Did something happen?

945
00:56:05,278 --> 00:56:07,322
Work has been stressing me out a bit.

946
00:56:08,448 --> 00:56:09,407
Yeah.

947
00:56:10,617 --> 00:56:12,911
Okay, I'll swing by soon.

948
00:56:13,620 --> 00:56:14,537
All right.

949
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:15,955
Okay.

950
00:56:19,542 --> 00:56:21,377
Kang Tae-moo, that bastard.

951
00:56:22,045 --> 00:56:25,465
I'm so stressed about that archaeopteryx.
I can't focus on anything.

952
00:56:25,548 --> 00:56:27,300
<i>Hey! I could have gotten hurt!</i>

953
00:56:27,383 --> 00:56:28,718
Jeez.

954
00:56:28,802 --> 00:56:30,762
Rich people are people too.

955
00:56:30,845 --> 00:56:34,516
Why do they only ever scream and yell?
They're always portrayed as the bad guys.

956
00:56:35,100 --> 00:56:36,017
I'm back.

957
00:56:36,101 --> 00:56:38,394
Hey! Did you…

958
00:56:39,020 --> 00:56:41,856
set a date for us
to meet with your girlfriend?

959
00:56:41,940 --> 00:56:42,982
Pardon?

960
00:56:43,066 --> 00:56:47,403
Why are you making that face?
Is something wrong?

961
00:56:49,447 --> 00:56:52,033
No, don't worry. You'll see her then.

962
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:53,827
Really?

963
00:57:01,459 --> 00:57:03,878
What is it now?

964
00:57:08,508 --> 00:57:09,759
Hello?

965
00:57:09,843 --> 00:57:11,344
<i>Where are you?</i>

966
00:57:11,427 --> 00:57:14,013
Where would I be at this hour?
I'm at home, of course.

967
00:57:14,097 --> 00:57:16,641
Then come down for a second.
I'm in front of your house.

968
00:57:18,351 --> 00:57:20,019
You're in front of my house? Now?

969
00:57:20,103 --> 00:57:21,479
Wait, hold on. Why?

970
00:57:27,235 --> 00:57:29,446
Why would you drop by this late
without telling me?

971
00:57:29,529 --> 00:57:31,406
I was about to go to bed.

972
00:57:32,031 --> 00:57:34,117
It looks like your lights are still on.

973
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,201
Oh, right.

974
00:57:35,285 --> 00:57:38,413
-Would you rather I let myself in?
-No! I'll come out!

975
00:57:38,496 --> 00:57:41,791
You just stay put, okay?

976
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,337
This guy is just so stubborn!

977
00:57:46,421 --> 00:57:49,048
Wait, what do I have to--

978
00:57:51,092 --> 00:57:52,177
First, let's…

979
00:58:01,603 --> 00:58:03,271
Can you even see anything?

980
00:58:07,066 --> 00:58:08,818
I thought you were about to go to bed.

981
00:58:08,902 --> 00:58:11,446
I never let anybody see
what I look like without makeup.

982
00:58:11,529 --> 00:58:13,156
It's like a rule as a woman.

983
00:58:14,616 --> 00:58:17,911
Judging by what you're wearing,
that "rule" doesn't seem to be consistent.

984
00:58:18,745 --> 00:58:20,997
Whatever.
Why did you come all the way here?

985
00:58:24,209 --> 00:58:26,127
I drafted up a contract. Take a look.

986
00:58:26,211 --> 00:58:28,838
And memorize my profile
before you meet my grandfather.

987
00:58:28,922 --> 00:58:32,175
I said I would think about it,
not that I would do it.

988
00:58:32,258 --> 00:58:35,386
I don't think
I have any other options but you.

989
00:58:35,970 --> 00:58:37,514
You said you would repay me.

990
00:58:37,597 --> 00:58:40,350
-So let's do it. A contract relationship.
-No.

991
00:58:40,850 --> 00:58:42,227
Just find some other woman.

992
00:58:45,230 --> 00:58:46,481
Damn it.

993
00:58:48,691 --> 00:58:49,817
Ms. Shin Geum-hui.

994
00:58:56,115 --> 00:58:57,659
Are you really going
to back out like this?

995
00:58:57,742 --> 00:58:59,911
No, that's not what I'm saying.

996
00:58:59,994 --> 00:59:02,997
It's because I really have
a reason I can't do it.

997
00:59:03,081 --> 00:59:04,499
<i>How am I supposed to fool</i>

998
00:59:04,582 --> 00:59:07,460
<i>both the president and chairman
of the company that I work at?</i>

999
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:09,379
What's your reason? Let's hear it.

1000
00:59:09,462 --> 00:59:11,005
So it's--

1001
00:59:15,718 --> 00:59:17,428
-Wait, first--
-What are you doing?

1002
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,639
Let's talk tomorrow!
